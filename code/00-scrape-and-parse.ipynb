    "\n",
    "`RedditReader`: A class for scraping Reddit using selenium. Because Reddit loads its post data dynamically in chunks, it was required to emulate a human user and scroll down the page as far as necessary to scrape the posts. The goal here was to avoid use of a much easier-to-use API.\n",
    "\n",
    "`RedditParser`: A class for parsing the Reddit page source for the necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scraper.py` module uses the following third-party packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `selenium` (requires Chrome as ChromeDriver is hardcoded in the script for now)\n",
    "- `bs4`\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual scraping and parsing done for this project was performed in ipython and the command line. I will replicate my steps below."
