(Humble brag: she read it!)Anyway, I wanted to examine Jennette McCurdy of Nickelodeon fame (Sam & Cat, iCarly, etc.). Her name has been buzzing around a lot lately due to the imminent release of her memoir: I'm Glad My Mom DiedTW: mentions assaultHere is Jennette's chart, Rodden rated A.  Below is a listing of biographical events from her memoir matched up against what I've seen in Jennette's chart.1) Let's address that title. McCurdy has Pluto in Scorpio in the 10th house, as the most elevated planet (closest to the midheaven). In some way, this indicates a public life, a career, and an image that is Plutonian in nature. Death is Plutonian--specifically humor around death, which McCurdy has used as a coping mechanism. There is something distinctly taboo about the paths 10H Pluto individuals take. Unfortunately, this raised up Pluto also predisposed her ascent into celebrity and status to be mired in controversy, control, and criminally abhorrent behavior. (Out on the other end, a public life that is transformational and healing for those on the receiving end of McCurdy's gifts)2) Her Mom. McCurdy has a Moon-Pluto opposition between Taurus and Scorpio, respectively. This opposition can manifest as a mother or childhood marked by extreme control, abuse of power, and in more abject cases, sexual and physical assault. It at the very least indicates a degree of intensity always at play. With this 4H Moon-10H Pluto configuration, her mom and childhood inevitably factor heavily in her career trajectory. And such was the case--McCurdy's mom intended for her daughter to become an actor, a failed dream of her own that she forced upon her daughter and then lived vicariously through. Her mother was sexually abusive, emotionally abusive, and encouraged McCurdy to restrict calories, leading to anorexia and bulimia that began at age 11. Her mom also had anorexia, untreated. She also forced McCurdy to work very long and grueling hours and to undergo invasive physical \"exams\" to make sure she didn't have cancer (McCurdy's mom had breast cancer when McCurdy was 2, and subsequently died when the cancer recurred 19 years later).The Taurus Moon opposing Pluto can present as an obsessive need to control one's body--how it looks, how it is being nurtured, how it is perceived. It can also present as anxiety around death and illness, with hypervigilent Pluto always directing the Taurus Moon (where the physical body reigns supreme) to look after the body and maintain the health\/beauty of the body in excessive and dangerous ways. That this behavior wad made manifest through her mom speaks to the exalted nature of the Moon in Taurus (insistent) in the 4H. Exalted planets can become caricatures, and can represent both our tendencies and the way others show up in our lives. Especially so as oppositions tend to manifest outwardly in relationship dynamics. (Taurus caricatures: obsessed with beauty, the body, hedonism, materialistic, etc.)McCurdy also has Mars in Taurus in the 4H--the battlefield was home (mother threw things at her and her siblings, etc.). Taurus things, like rest, food, beauty and self-care, were weaponized against McCurdy.  (Note: Mars is debilitated in Taurus, which may not incline one to fight back or assert themselves. Mars in Taurus fights to maintain peace and stability, which sometimes means becoming passive)Both Mars and Moon answer to Venus in Cancer in the 6th house, a sensitive and loving placement that can long to please and serve others to the detriment of caring for itself.Also, McCurdy was forced into acting, among other reasons, in order to support her family monetarily. It also turns out her small fortune was mishandled (by...her mother?) (Taurus caricatures).","title-cc":55,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":3848,"body-wc":637,"media":0,"comments":30},"142":{"time":"2022-08-10","title":"Malefic vs benefic","body-text":"How does one know if a placement are benefic or malefic?

My point being that the Houses (1-12) are no different from the order of the signs (1-12), meaning that no matter which chart you look at, the first sign and everything therein will pertain to the persons sense of self and outward appearance and so on. Therefore, defining that area as the 1st house seems purely aesthetic to me and lacks value, as it is already a part of the eastern rising zodiac. This in turn makes it kind of silly to bring up Houses as part of the \"big 4\" topics of astrology, being Signs, Aspects, Planets, and Houses.I don't really know that much about the methods and systems used in astrological tools and techniques, so I can't really articulate the problem better, I just feel that systems like Placidus makes Houses different from the Signs and therefore worth it to differentiate them into two topics.Speaking mostly to astrologers using WSH, are houses actually worth talking about as a different topic other than including their descriptions into the prevalent Signs? Why\/How do you do that?TL;DR Houses are no different from the order of the Signs in WSH and doesn't make sense to be its own topic, and I would like to know why houses are used in WSH astrology and not just incorporated into the Signs' order of appearance.Edit: As a lot of people have said that my post is poorly worded. To clear things up I meant that the terminology of Houses is redudant as you can simply refer to the first appearing Sign in ones chart (Asc) when talking about the sense of self, or the 6th appearing sign for services and daily routines. However as I've been told, this would only lead to confusion when learing about astrology and some important aspects of the Houses that I was not aware of would disappear.

No sign-up needed for this. I really encourage people to watch it, especially if you are a bit new to reading charts (and even if you are not). You can find it here:https:\/\/nightlightastrology.com\/events\/#leisa-shaimShe covers a set of twins born 3 months apart (yes months) and how this was reflected in their birth charts, a pair of women who discovered at age72 they\u2019d been switched at birth, a couple of sad\/tragic cases, someone with a record number of times being struck by lightning (and lived), a wedding chart and someone who gave birth having never known they were pregnant. Leisa goes into the charts of all these cases, and it is fascinating.No matter the actual stories, a lot can be learned just watching her explain how all these charts accurately reflected the experiences of the natives or events. And would be fun to discuss here. This is quality astrology in action.She pauses before each new case, after describing it, and asks the viewers if they can guess some placements before she shows the chart\/s.

She spends quite a bit of time on the 3rd House, and I wanted to use some of her insights as a jumping off point for a discussion on The 3rd House as a whole.On page 182 Bell quotes one of my favorite astrology books of all time, Robert Hand's Horoscope Symbols, when he says the 3rd House \"contain[s] a great number of seemingly unrelated ideas.\" He goes on further, saying the 3rd House has an unconscious element, a \"lack of choosing,\" as the one common denominator tying together the 3rd's themes.At the time I read (and re-read) Horoscope Symbols I was very early in my studies, and immediately understood this highly nuanced idea, while quite plausible, would take time for me to ever discern its own truth for myself. Only after reading Planetary Threads, and running into Hand's statement again, have I realized I've always described my biggest passions -- like astrology -- as choosing me, rather than I choosing them.From a more Traditional perspective, The 3rd House is the Moon's Joy. Traditionally The Moon had many\/most of the original significations of Mercury, and to this day Moon in Cancer folk have a strong tendency towards writing. When we assign The 3rd to the Moon, this sense of unconscious fate\/intuition guiding is makes far more sense.The 3rd House is a Cadent house. Houses are either Angular, Cadent, or Succedent. Angular houses are the \"stakes\" of the chart; they represent the spine, and any planets angular act out on the world stage.Cadent and Succedent houses are more subtle. Cadent houses are considered the weakest houses, and while the other three cadent houses -- the 6th, 8th and 12th -- get most of the bad press in astrology, the 3rd is cadent as well and is only slightly better due to its sextile with the Ascendant. The 6th, 8th and 12th do not make any Ptolemiac aspect to the Ascendant, making any energies stored in those houses available only through indirect means.3rd House Themes and Rulerships:\"Brothers and sisters, cousins or general members of the family (not parents, they belong to the 4th house). Neighbours and our local neighbourhood. The environment in which we live and work. Short journeys or those made on a regular basis.Letters, rumours, reports, messages and messengers.

Haven't yet found anything more accurate (still looking). This is based on the fact that the Supreme Court releases decisions starting at 10am, and if there are multiple decisions, each is announced in 10  minute intervals. The first announcement was the Becerra case. The Dobbs case (the Roe v Wade one) was second, making 10:10am the assumed time. Earliest news site announcements that I could find (so far) were 10:17am. Between 10:10 and 10:16, neither the ascendant nor anything else changes signs.For any that don't know, Roe v Wade in the US granted abortion rights to women.  Within minutes of the Supreme Court decision announcement, multiple states who had trigger laws already in place have now outlawed all abortion. There are reports of women already in clinics for their appointments today being turned away.Edit:  While I caution against political comments,  there is some contention in the threads that I just want to clarify.  Yes,  part of how all this happened is that there has been no law, no constitutional amendment protecting women's rights in this issue.

Gives a real taste of the planetary archetypes both in natal and transit astrology. I hope no one finds this offensive, as I know sometimes peering into current violence\/darkness using astrology can be inappropriate. I don't *think* this is one of those times, but I'm willing to be wrong. Let me know!Ezra Miller, an actor, has been in the news recently for allegedly kidnapping an indigenous woman (Takota) and her three young children, keeping them on a compound filled with guns. The mother is apparently there of her own volition, though the father of the children denies this. The father is also allegedly abusive. Takota's parents also believe she is being held hostage and fed drugs, and released photos of a bruised Takota. In the past, Ezra has also been accused of grooming a child, harassing a child and their parents, excessive displays of public violence and disorderly conduct, choking, etc. Openly walks around with guns and a bulletproof vest.I'm not going to pretend to know what the truth of the matter is, only to highlight how compelling this all is astrologically.Here is a brief snippet of what I have observed in Ezra's chart, rated AA. (jk turns out this wasn't brief after all)(((((Thanks @dashrimpofdoom for correcting me, Ezra is in a 6H year, not a 7H year. I\u2019ve edited this post now to reflect that. ))))))Ezra's natal Mars is in Cancer in the 3rd house. It is currently being squared by Jupiter in Aries (their 12th house), and is getting a wider\/fading square from Mars in Aries.Natally, their Mars in Cancer is configured in a T-square, opposing Neptune and Mars in Capricorn, and squaring the Sun in Libra. Ezra is also in their Saturn Return.So...an INTENSE activation of this natal T-square, which speaks to a very histrionic, erratic, and impulsive character. Even violent. Some actors pour their natal stress into roles and characters, as Ezra has in the past. But that is quickly becoming eclipsed by their real-world actions.Mars in Cancer opposing Neptune and Uranus makes for erratic and impulsive displays of energy, exacerbated by choices and thought processes that are a little delusional (Neptune). Abuse of drugs (Mars in a water sign, Neptune in general) also feeds into this behavior. And I think this compound is on a marijuana farm.","title-cc":35,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":2399,"body-wc":418,"media":0,"comments":12},"446":{"time":"2022-07-01","title":"People with Aquarius sun\/moon\/asc placements: what\u2019s life been like for you since Saturn entered Aquarius?","body-text":"how have the key themes of Saturn shown up for you?and how are you feeling its energy\u2014i.e., is it surface-level, or is it felt deep within your soul-level? or is it more subtle or not felt at all?","title-cc":106,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":196,"body-wc":43,"media":0,"comments":44},"447":{"time":"2022-07-01","title":"What is a strong chart according to you?","body-text":"What makes you see a chart and be like ooof this person is going to be one hell of a personality? aIs it the trines? the harsher aspects?","title-cc":40,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":137,"body-wc":28,"media":0,"comments":152},"448":{"time":"2022-07-01","title":"What was your favorite source for learning about houses\/trines\/all the complexities of a natal chart?","body-text":"I have only basic knowledge pertaining to sun, moon, rising, Mars and Venus.

Acts of self-care may be performed in the sanctuary of home. Our relationship to value and material may be informed by the family we are born into. To feel rooted in the 4th house supports the growth of confidence in the 2nd house. Alternatively, the means we gain in the 2nd house may afford us home and privacy, or otherwise help us earn a sense of groundedness or belonging.3rd house to 5th house: The 3rd house of communication and familiarity is supported by the 5th house of creativity, play and pleasure. All creative endeavors may start first with a unique point of view. Play and recreation can keep the mind fresh, and open to receive new information. We may first play in our immediate environments. The 5th house also supports the 3rd house by turning insight into expression. Children are very expressive and speak their mind freely.4th house to 6th house: The 4th house of home, roots, foundation and privacy is supported by the 6th house of health, routine, service and mastery of skill. Being able to perform service to the world is enhanced by having a private and personal space to recharge in. Some may fall into trades that have a family lineage (i.e., coming from a long line of cobblers or actors). Our illnesses may be hereditary, and we are first modeled how to tend to our health by our parents. Standing proudly in our personal culture and ancestry may inform the work we wish to do in the world.5th house to 7th house: The 5th house of creativity, play and pleasure is supported by the 7th house of others. Having fun with another person can be additive. Or some may wish to enjoy life with a partner, best friend, or confidant. Partnership itself may be the pleasure. Flirtation, dating and romance may be a delightful precursor to partnership. Our creations are enhanced when they are witnessed and received by others, or when we are able to share the process of creation with another (collaboration). It takes two to make a child.6th house to 8th house: The 6th house of health, routine, service and mastery of skill is supported by the 8th house of shared assets, the occult, intimacy and complexity. The depth of the service we offer the world may be enhanced by a willingness to peer into the self. Compensation for a job comes from an employer with whom you share an implicit contract, and through whom you pay taxes. If you are the employer, you may be involved in large and complex transactions on behalf of another. Occult interests may turn into daily practice or devotions. Our physical health may be impacted by the baggage we carry or may be enhanced by closeness with another. To become deeply enmeshed with the work you do.","title-cc":96,"title-wc":14,"body-cc":4146,"body-wc":739,"media":0,"comments":28},"468":{"time":"2022-07-01","title":"What does a grand fire trine mean?","body-text":"What does a grand fire trine mean?

Sun signs seem to align more with what they've been pushed to embrace in their life and almost never match them close enough for them to take it seriously, while rising signs seem to be traits that they or others deny but they benefit from being encouraged to express.Basically I would describe the sun sign is the identity others project into them - negative or positive - and they DO exhibit but not out of choice. These are the traits others pick up on easily and encourage. The rising sign is the energy they find comfort in and want to express - its the light emanating from them and they want to be recognized for - but this is often suppressed or denied over time. Instead the rising defines what we crave recognition for.What I started noticing is that when people are discouraged from embracing the aspects of their rising sign, they seem to lean heavily into their moon sign - it's like a comfortable middle ground or coping mechanism. It really defines how we cope with that turmoil.Do you think this is accurate or do you have a different perspective?","title-cc":55,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":1478,"body-wc":263,"media":0,"comments":107},"492":{"time":"2022-06-01","title":"A very newbie Question - Please be kind Lol","body-text":"Okay so with Astrology there are various \"systems\".You have chinese, you have greek-roman, etc.So what system do you use and why?Next if the systems provide different answers than doesn't that invalidate them all together?

It is seen to be on a throne, with no other planet exerting influence over it.

Saturn is stationing retrograde on the same day.We are VERY lucky that this is a refranation (meaning that the aspect never quuuuiiite perfects), because in my experience when Mercury stations are exactly afflicted by malefics it can be difficult on a scale that is more than an inconvenience. If such an aspect makes a direct hit on your natal chart, either you or someone close to you could suffer a major Mercury-related loss. But since this situation is not quuuiiite happening, the threat is there, but may well stop before the blow lands.Car, phone, laptop: these are the usual suspects. But Saturn rules the teeth, hair, skin and bones, and is stationing retrograde tomorrow. So add that whole general theme to the idea of loss, and be careful with yourself. And then of course there is money. Payment delays, thefts, unexpected expenses: all are possible, but with the double station of Mercury and Saturn they may reverse or not come out the way you expected. You might get things back.Algol is the most malefic star in the heavens and indicates mass casualty events in a way similar to Pluto. Mercury is communication. So we're talking about mass shootings\/bombings etc. and what our cultural response should be. Saturn likes to restrict things, so restrictive laws about weapons acquisition is in the air.Another thing with Mercury and Saturn is that Mercury rules trade, and Saturn rules barriers. So the square makes it a lot harder to bring trade goods across borders. Mercury also rules theft though, so a conversation about what to do to prevent the sale of stolen goods would fit.Also, Mercury in Taurus is interested in food, so when it's square Saturn - why is it so hard to get food? High prices, supply chain issues, outright graft? It's not great to have this influence during the cultivation season in so many places. Saturn is a reaper, not a sower.Also, Mercury rules vehicles . . . gas prices make us want to delay or curtail trips.Mercury also rules the lungs. Square Saturn means affliction of same; conjunct Algol means \"heaped up corpses\" so try not to be exposed to Covid or other respiratory ailments ESPECIALLY now but yes obviously in general too.Lastly, Saturn rules things that are difficult, and Mercury rules learning. Saturn usually means failure, penalty, cancellation or delay, but here we have a refranation so I think more likely will be great mental exertion (while feeling tired). Also, fines and penalties being dismissed could be a possibility - think of a situation where the hammer almost comes down, but then like magic just stops. Still, this odd combination is not typically great for schools, nor for authority figures. And it should be interesting to see whether court judgments get reversed.Saturn is in his domicile in Aquarius, so this at least is helpful. His harshness is not a pointless power trip; it's for a greater purpose that furthers long-term goals. This being the case, try to see what long-term trajectory Saturn could be altering when things appear to go wrong. Is this adjustment actually of benefit?","title-cc":65,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":3145,"body-wc":535,"media":0,"comments":73},"532":{"time":"2022-06-01","title":"What is the (most logical) explanation as to why astrology works?","body-text":"I believe in astrology, but trying to explain it to friends that are interested but ask me what is the mechanism behind it that makes it work.I know the moon (and stars?) affect bodies of water, and we're 60%+ water, so of course at least the moon will have an effect.

All lectures\/textbooks always stop at, say, \u201cMars is in Cancer and is therefore unable to receive.\u201d They never consider any potential mitigating factors for Mars. But they also don\u2019t state outright that the analysis must end there, so it\u2019s difficult to say whether this omission is intentional. What do you do in your practice?Example: planet A is peregrine but is technically received by planet B. Planet B is in fall though. Do you stop here and say that planet B can\u2019t receive planet A, so planet A remains peregrine? Or do you continue going down the chain to discover that planet C cancels B\u2019s debility, so you declare that B can actually receive A, and A isn\u2019t peregrine after all?2. Do you use almutens and if so, do you consider them more important than domicile rulers? In his 1996 lectures, Robert Hand called the Ascendant\u2019s almuten the \u201ctrue ruler\u201d of that Ascendant. For example, he explained Hitler\u2019s chart by pointing out that his \u201ctrue ruler\u201d wasn\u2019t Venus, but debilitated Saturn. (Side note: Hand said he was using both Ptolemy\u2019s and Dorothean triplicity rulers for different purposes but never specified. He calculated the Ascendant\u2019s almuten with Ptolemy\u2019s system, so I assume he would follow Dorotheus for dividing house topics into three. Has anyone seen other practitioners using this approach? Do you personally use it?) On the other hand, Luis Ribeiro and Helena Avelar recommend using almutens merely as an additional flavor to domicile rulers. Their examples look similar to the way some practitioners describe planets located in the bounds of other planets.

Please if you don't know what profections are go to other posts or watch the Astrology Podcast on Annual Profections).I'm aware of three different ways it is possible to use  profections:\u2022 Annual Profections (as explained in the Astrology Podcast and in the book \"Abu Ma' Shar on Solar Returns by Benjamin Dykes\") This is the time lord technique in wich each house ruler gets to be a year time lord deppending in the profected sign of the Ascendant. The topis associated with that time lord by position, rulership and aspect would be activated for that year. Then looking to the solar return and transits, we could get info about how well those topics would work.\u2022 Profected Chart: (this was the technique my astrology teacher taught me). In this technique we profect every planets of the chart. So in the first house profected year every planet would be in the same sign they are in the natal chart. While, for example, in the seventh house profected year every planet would be in the sign opposite to their natal position. (As I have not found a lot of info about this way of using profections, I'm questioning if this way of using them is correct or not).\u2022 Profected Planets: (I have seen this one here and there but I have not found a lot of information about how should we interpret it and what differenes this technique has in relation to the Annual Profections) This is similar to the previous technique. Tho in this one instead of profecting the whole chart astrologers only profect specific planets\/ponits, namely the Ascendant, The Sun, The Moon and the MC.My questions are:Which technique do you use?How do you profect The Sun and The Moon? (In case you use this technique).Also in Annual Profections, do you pay attention to the degree of the profected Ascendant or regardless of the degree, the time lord changes always in the native birth day\/ solar return day?","title-cc":42,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":2057,"body-wc":366,"media":0,"comments":14},"575":{"time":"2022-06-01","title":"Books similar to Astrology for the Soul\u2026","body-text":"I love this book.

When I have wanted to compare charts between two people, I have taken both charts and overlaid them onto of each other using photoshop and transparency,  I can see interesting transits and placements. But I see that chart synastry calcators onlinr show a different result where my chart, or anyone that I am comparing looks different from the natal chart. I am wondering how this is calculated, is it not possible to simply look at them aide by side or overlay them to find synastry? The results with an online synastry chart is completely different.Edit: I have updated with more clarification of what I meanI have made a photoshop image to try and show what I am meaning, sorry its a bit hard to understand. https:\/\/imgur.com\/ySpEFmKSo, when using astro-seek or any of the popular synastry websites, one persons chart is always rotated on its axis so that the sign houses match up for each person. For example in my image, you can see in the top right, the astro-seek synastry. This is Brads chart compared to Angelinas. In this chart, Brads is as it was, but Angelinas horizon line has been rotated on its axis so the houses match, you can change it so that Angalinas is normal and Brads has been rotated too on the website.Either way, someones chart has to be rotated on its axis so that the signs fit with the other persons. Libra in one persons chart matching with Libra in the compared person chart, Leo with Leo etc, the chart is rotated in one induvidual so the signs match up. But in actuality these signs may have be in totally different parts of the sky during the time of birth for each person and this style of comparison creates an inacruate image of how the sky was at the time of birth for each person.With synastry charts it always changes at least one persons chart to match up with the others and its never a true representation and comparison of the actual sky at the time of birth of two people.With the top left chart, this is my layered image of both birth charts of each person on top of eachother with transparency. The horizon line is exactly left as it is so that its not rotated. Neither persons chart has been rotated. Surely with this method, you can see interesting aspect line interaction that may be key to understanding snyastry that is muddled up and changed from how it should be when one persons horizon line has been rotated substantially to fit the signs up together? We can get a clear picture and comparison of the horoscope of each induvidual compared to eachother unlike when you rotate the axis of one persons round.Sorry this is super obtuse sounding, but I hope I have been able to explain it. My question is, is my method of overlaying the charts and leaving the horizon line as is useful, or even better in some ways to see interesting aspect line interaction?

And so on and so forth.Has anyone ever discussed Jupiter to Neptune Conjunctions and their effects on society? Before delving into this, we need to understand the sociological effects of Neptune [when it's in each sign]. Because Neptune represents dreams, idealizations, escapism, fantasy, and inspiration being a slow-moving nature, its impact on society is profound and therefor safe to conclude that it is the planet that symbolizes the zeitgeist. Broadly speaking, Neptune inWater Signs effects on society is empathy of the downtrodden and marginalized with growing division while the culture LEANS Politically Left.Fire Signs effects on society is rabid polarization based on identity and\/or ideology.Earth Signs effects on society is Economic and financial focused with growing apathy while the culture LEANS Politically Right.Air Signs effects on society is tech focused while the culture LEANS Politically Centrist or Apathetic.Moving on, we all know what the planet Jupiter symbolizes; all things expansionism, freedom or liberation, and the proliferation of ideas.

Is it typical for people to like experience the influence of one, or for one to \u201cfeel\u201d like they resonate with their 10th house a bit more in terms of career\/ public life? Does anyone have any experience with how this might make sense to the native\u2019s chart or if they may gravitate towards one over the other?

Understand the finalized opinion is not released nor official. If\/when it is, it will remove the federal right to abortion and leave the right up to individual states to determine. Protesters have already flocked to the Supreme Court building (live news as of midnight in Washington.)

For now, I'll use the publish time on the article, since this is the \"event\", that is, when we learned about it. The actual draft opinion is dated Feb 10th, 2022, so that may be a chart to look at, though we usually use a public release for things like this. Since the document was leaked, and because it has not actually been published by the Supreme Court yet (no final opinion has been handed down, but the formal opinion is expected in June), we won't have anything like an official publishing time by the Supreme Court itself yet.The charts:Chart of the Roe v Wade Supreme Court Decision (Jan 22, 1973 at 10:00am in Washington, DC, USA.

This is a \"draft\" opinion, not finalized, though it likely is a done deal, and has been obvious it's been coming for a long time. (The court was turned when the Senate refused to even hear Obama's nomination of Garland for justice, even refused to allow a vote. That moment in time is tied to the current makeup of the Supreme Court. Not sure how to do a chart for that.) The 1973 Roe v Wade case made it illegal for states to make a law that restricts abortion. However, even when the final Supreme Court decision comes down, Congress still has the power to make it null and void, by passing a law protecting the citizens from states making it illegal.","title-cc":138,"title-wc":23,"body-cc":3040,"body-wc":532,"media":0,"comments":71},"678":{"time":"2022-05-02","title":"How to work out birth time without an accurate time?","body-text":"Is there a way to do this to get aspects correct and the planets in the right signs?

So, I wanted to share my thoughts on the matter and find some answers to some questions. So please feel free to comment. Have in mind that I will be focusing in topics of traditional astrology which some begginers might not know. Besides this might be a theoretical discussion, but you are free to share how these topics actualy work in practice.1- Joys, Malefics in housesThis was actualy the topic that made me want to write this post in the first place. Because I have found completely different points of view on the matter. Basicaly each planet has a house where it prefers to be in. The malefics have their joys in the malefic houses 6 and 12. I have seen people saying that while is good the have the other planets in their joys, it is bad to have Mars and Saturn in their joys because they get more malefic. Although, what was explained to me was the opposite,  having the malefics in malefic houses can actualy be good for three reasons:While Mercury has it joy in the 1 house, the benefics and luminars have their joys in houses which are in sextil and trine to the Asc. The malefics have their joys in houses averse to the Asc.Since these joys are averse to the Asc it is less likely for them to be angular and near the angles, specialy to the MC and IC axis.While the benefics affirm and expand, the malefics deny and restrict.

I note that in the Ukraine chart, this is locked in for the next 6 months, in the Ukraine\u2019s house of the military, the 6th house, which is also Mars' House of Joy (not to be confused at all with joyful things, ie mars likes war, so to speak).The other thing I notice is that the sun is in the 8th house (and widely conjunct Chiron). This house has to do with public mortality, the death rate, the kinds of people who die (per skyscript.co.uk) I note the Sun (which represents the president of a country) is here in the 8th. We can\u2019t know exactly what that means, at least not without several other factors. The sun in mundane represents the president, prime minister, monarch, etc. as well as cabinet ministers, and other persons of authority for the country.The chart ruler (ruler of the asc) mercury, is placed in the 7th house of foreign affairs, relations with other countries, including hostilities.Astrology never ceases to amaze me. I've made note of this besiegement configuration in a number of charts, and the accuracy is notable, even though that shouldn't really surprise me.Here is a resource from Skycript for the Mundane meanings of planets and houses. For beginners, don't apply personal natal astrology to things like the charts of countries - planets and houses vary in meanings.","title-cc":132,"title-wc":17,"body-cc":2763,"body-wc":492,"media":0,"comments":4},"939":{"time":"2022-04-02","title":"Intelligent arguments and appreciation for astrology wanted!","body-text":"Astrology has always been very interesting to me, and it is sometimes frustrating that it is completely dismissed as a new age pseudoscience.The other end of the spectrum is also frustrating, and can be seen all across Instagram and TikTok, reductionist views and sensationalist dialogue over profound, cultural, historical, and spiritual concepts.

I just want to get my theories out there to know if whether I'm the only one who thinks how this works. It is my firm belief that when dealing with these planetsThe themes of both Uranus and Pluto symbolize their eccentricities in which Uranus is known to represent complex eccentric phenomenon through an communicative \/ intellectual style when anything comes to contact with it while Pluto represents complex mysterious struggles for power through an passionate \/ sensitive manner. Both planets occur from an individual to societal level.Because of what was stated #1, Pluto and Uranus have something in common, it is concluded that they are both unpredictable. However, one can crack the code of them by understanding that they're also both \"people power\" planets.Therefor, the hard aspects of Uranus to Pluto and knowing that they're odd and eccentric \"people power\" planets, a COLLECTIVE OF HUMAN INDIVIDUALS are \"called\" to action by these two planets. As a result, two generations of people born under a Pluto sign or a cusp between two Pluto Signs launch a significant revolution challenging society's ways of thinking, doing, or even looking. The revolution's focal point will depend largely on what the values of revolutionaries Pluto Signs were born into.So we know what the revolution is about depending on the Pluto Sign of when the revolutionaries were born under. But do we know the revolution's long-lasting legacy on society? Paradigm shifts? Mode of thought, or discourse? One can find out by looking to where Uranus and Pluto are when making the aspects.ExamplesUranus to Pluto Conjunction of 1965 - 66A revolution known as the counterculture movement arose from 1965 and lasted until 1974. Largely a reaction against the industrial 1950's (when society was in peak Modernism), it emphasized on what a society should act like. Major themes of it was happenings, street theatre, body art, and music - all performance related. Sounds like the Leo archetype? Pluto was in Leo from 1937 - 1956 (and the Cancer-Leo Cusp from 1928 - 1942 if we are counting Neptune's influence). These people all came of age at the correct time to be the vanguards of this change. Art itself also changed where working on the piece was emphasized instead of the finished art piece - which is known as conceptual art.Long lasting legacies of that revolution was that civilization was culturally changed, while Postmodernism, a mode of thought, arouse out of it. Defining characteristics from that period \"transforming\" into Postmodernism is that experience is interpreted as subjective instead of objective, all grand narratives are to be rejected, and all institutions are to be held in high skepticism. Sounds a little like the Virgo archetype? This Conjunction was occurring in the analytical, highly critical Virgo. To put it simply, think of person born in a Leo sign attempting a revolt through a Virgo fashion.This is my theory of civilizational change through the lens of astrology in a nutshell.","title-cc":75,"title-wc":14,"body-cc":3063,"body-wc":500,"media":0,"comments":5},"963":{"time":"2022-03-03","title":"Agrippa\u2019s Three Books of Occult Philosophy","body-text":"","title-cc":42,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":3},"964":{"time":"2022-03-03","title":"Are there any \u201creverse astrology\u201d app\/ websites?","body-text":"An app or website where you basically have an empty burthchart and you choose random planets\/ asteroids\/ signs for different houses and it tells you the birth time?","title-cc":48,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":164,"body-wc":28,"media":0,"comments":4},"965":{"time":"2022-03-03","title":"H\u00e1s there ever been a chart w every planet in their home sign?","body-text":"So I was thinking, in history has there ever been a recorded chart where all the planets were in their home sign and house?

But I've been aware for a couple years now since the Capricorn clump of 2020 motivated me to look back at Capricorn transits of the past... there's been a big preponderance of outer planet activity in Capricorn in the last 40 years (as well as Aquarius, making for very Saturnian times).I start this period with Neptune's entrance into Capricorn in Jan 1984, where it was quickly conjuncted by Jupiter the next day. Then Saturn and Uranus both enter in 1988. Saturn conjuncts Neptune in 1989. Uranus conjuncts Neptune in 1993. Then Jupiter conjuncts Neptune again in 1997 before Neptune leaves Capricorn. We get a bit of a reprieve from Capricorn for about 10 years after this, BUT Uranus and Neptune are still in a Saturn sign, Aquarius, until 2003 and 2011 respectively, so we're not completely free of the Saturnian energy. Then in Dec 2007, Jupiter enters Capricorn again, soon to be followed by Pluto about a month later in Jan 2008. Pluto will remain in Capricorn until 2024 (dipping into Aquarius in 2023). During this time, we had the 2020 Capricorn clump when Saturn and Jupiter both conjuncted Pluto within a couple months of each other, which was also highlighted by Mars doing the same around the same time.The hot spots of this period appear to be around 1989\/1990ish, 2008 and 2020. Notable world events around those times are obviously the fall of the Soviet Union, the Great Recession and the Covid pandemic. The most notable innovation during this time is definitely the internet (Capricornian systematic hardware of computers meets the abstract networking\/people power of Aquarius. Internet took off most notably during the 1997-2003 transit of Uranus in Aquarius while Neptune was there as well. Prior to that, computers were more Capricornian without the internet, and home computing spread notably after 1984 when Apple introduced the Macintosh).I'd love to hear thoughts on what we think this would mean for 2024 and beyond when this period finally ends. Once Pluto leaves Capricorn for good in 2024... the next big Capricorn transit we'll have will only be a year long solitary Jupiter transit in 2031 (conjuncts Pluto in Aquarius in 2033). It won't be until 2047 that Saturn gets back to Capricorn (it never conjuncts Pluto in Aquarius), and most of us probably won't even live to see Uranus get back there, let alone Neptune or Pluto. Pluto does, however, remain in a Saturn sign until 2044, so it may not be until then that we see this Saturnian period truly \"end\". But I think, largely, it's been a Capricorn period more than an Aquarius period, and that ends in 2024. The Aquarius period that begins with Pluto in Aquarius will be much different, I believe.From what I can tell by quickly looking ahead, the next sign to really get this kind of attention from outer planet conjunctions in a span of a few decades is Taurus from about 2098 to 2128. Looking to the past, I'd say the last time was Gemini from 1882 to 1914 (during which, we saw automobiles and motion pictures advance, both very Gemini-ruled things).Anyway, yeah... I'd love to hear more thoughts on this. Especially in the last couple years, it's felt like we've hit the bottom of the Capricorn barrel, which has been the darkest time of the darkest sign of the zodiac... and I'm hoping 2024 will signal a shift to a different, maybe more positive time than perhaps I've ever seen in my life (I was born after 1984, so I've lived my whole life so far within this period). Pluto in Aquarius notwithstanding, I'm looking forward to seeing what it'll be like to see the world finally come out from under the weight of Saturn and the intensity\/darkness of Capricorn.","title-cc":48,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":3762,"body-wc":658,"media":0,"comments":61},"1050":{"time":"2022-03-03","title":"People with Scorpio in the 4th House, how is your relationship with your family and how was your childhood?","body-text":"Anyone with a Scorpio 4 House?How was your childhood?

The thing is. I love how the 7 traditional meanings were created. There is a sence of group and use of similarities and differences between the seven. Example: Venus represents love and peace, while Mars, rivalry and fights. Saturn represents boundaries, while Jupiter freedom. When astrologers speak about the modern ones they explain them individualy. Besides most of the meanings of the modern planets were stolen from the traditional ones.In the interpretation I use:traditional planets: sign, house, dignity, ruled houses and aspectsmodern planets: house and aspectsOne analogy that I like about the three modern planets, associates each of them with a transformation process related to a natural disaster.Uranus: a sudden hurricane that shakes things.Neptune: a flood that dissolves things, or a mist that blurs things.Pluto: a deep earthquake that destroys things.Tho, this meanings may only be used when looking to transits. I don't know if we should use them when looking at their house in a natal chart or aspects. There is also the idea of the \"higher octaves\" of Mercury, Venus and Mars.I watched the three astrology podcast videos on these three planets, but I wanted to know your opinion and how you use them.

But then I see that moon and saturn are squaring these placements.

They're planets after all, and bigger ones at that; thus I think it's safe to say that their influence should not be underestimated.For the above reason I find the correct assessment of the outer planets' signification to be a paramount astrological matter to deal with in this day and age.However since their discovery is relatively new there must be a certain amount of conjecture in interpreting their characteristics, meaning it's potentially misleading and even harmful to interpret them haphazardly.In investigating the meaning of outer planets I'd like to clear the picture from the ground up, and I was wondering specifically about the attribution of their names, e.g. why Pluto has been chosen instead of, let's say, Vulcan as the god\/principle behind this planet.Moreover, there must be a link between the denominations and the rulerships that had been assigned to them (i.e. Aquarius, Pisces and Scorpio respectively). Has this link been arbitraliy made? To what extent?I'm guessing the gods' names have been chosen before, but it might just as well have been the other way around, meaning they were relatively fitting the characteristics of the alleged rulers.What drove Uranus to be Uranus? Neptune to be Neptune? Do the rulers have something to do with it, or was it the other way around? In any case, why were those specific associations made?","title-cc":119,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":1942,"body-wc":328,"media":0,"comments":24},"1085":{"time":"2022-03-03","title":"How do you go about studying astrology","body-text":"I have approached studying astrology in a very open minded way.

Actually, Venus has been slowing down for a bit now, called a station, meaning her footprint is heavy in the sky. Likely, you've already been acquainted with the pitter pattering of themes you can expect during this period. Venus retrograde corresponds to general themes such as: relationship reviews, rewinds, renewals and reversals--evaluating how you relate to your own self-worth and esteem--retooling what you actually value\/need--budgeting, getting serious about finances--hiccups with beauty related tools, industries, purchases and decisions.But Venus RX means more when you account for the house it will be drudging stuff up in. My general take on Venus RX is: detouring into the ugly and resurfacing with a new appreciation of beauty.  Kind of like the plot of Shrek. Where are the ogres in your life? And can you just decide to marry them and live happily ever after in a swamp with your donkey dragon friends? I digress...This RX will be decidedly less brutal than the 2018 one in Scorpio. Those were some dire, uggo times. Venus in Gemini is peregrine, and to me, far more effervescent. Like a La Croix. Some gross flavors. But mostly ok. The reviews and themes will have more to do with ideas, thoughts, beliefs, etc. Very much juggling many dissonant thoughts and being okay with not settling on a conclusion. This will be a mentally exhausting time for some.Gemini occupies a house in everyone's chart. Welcome to the circus:First House: a time to reconsider what makes you feel beautiful, to redefine what beauty has to mean and look like. a time of enhanced social awareness (from a distance) and learning how you bring a distinct value to people--but first settling on how you wish to value yourself. being comfortable with your many faces, but also eliminating the faces, the out-grown personalities, that do not suit you anymoreSecond House: a time to reevaluate how material possessions add beauty, add value, add ease-- or completely distract you from the assets that matter the most. a renewed version of self-care, a hard and honest look at your bank account and closet and cabinets, a purging to make room for new beautiful things to bloom. divine dividendsThird House:  a time to reconsider what needs to be said. holding space for new ideas to take the place of old ones. learning to value your unique perspective, whilst also respecting the perspectives of others. work that neuro plasticity, pave new grooves into your gray matter. a time to stop and smell the roses as you are out and about. rekindling bonds with siblings and teammates.Fourth House: a time to spackle, paint, hang and rearrange. where has the beauty in your home become stagnant, and how can you insert new pathways of inspiration into your halls? retooling your roots, beautifying your sanctuaries, finding Aphrodite in your ancestry. this can be a time to reacquaint yourself with the value a tribe, a home, a family, and a foundation gives you. that's how beauty can blossom.Fifth House: a time to make friends with that blinking cursor on a blank page, the dried paint brush, the stack of half-finished poetry in the corner of your room, and the project that makes your heart sing--but that you've been too afraid to sing along with. retool your relationship with your inner child, that spark in the dark. your authentic self could use some authenticatingSixth House: a time to throw out ugly habits, dead-end jobs, and the futile and self-deprecating sense of duty and responsibility you hold. time for new rituals. time put your worth and value ahead of the needs of others. you are more than a cog in a machine. you are the machine. an extraordinary one. and an extraordinary one needs all the tonics, tinctures, remedies and herbs. beautiful insides make for a beautiful outside, so celebrate your vitality, and appreciate all that your body does--in sickness and in health","title-cc":57,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":3926,"body-wc":674,"media":0,"comments":328},"1192":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Looking Foward To This !!!

To date, Courtney Stodden, model, and Michael Costello, fashion designer, have come forward with visual proof of Chrissy\u2019s mean girl past. In both cases, Chrissy urged that her targets ought to kill themselves. That's pretty harsh. As an astrologer, I'm always interested in the inner workings of planetary energies that underpin this kind of acute news. While some don't agree with looking at celebrity charts, I find that it is tremendously helpful in learning planetary archetypes, timing techniques, and the general effect that planetary movements can have on us mere mortals. So, in this take, I investigate the natal chart of Chrissy Teigen, and pinpoint some of the planetary energies that could be at play for her now.But first some housekeeping. Whenever you are looking into the chart of a politician, or a musician, or any other kind of public figure, you're going to want to make sure that their birth data is accurate. There are a lot of websites out there that purport to have the accurate natal charts of certain celebrities, but some of them are less reputable than others. I suggest using Astro.com. There you can find the rating of a chart. Chrissy\u2019s chart is rated A, meaning there is a strong likelihood of accuracy. (The best rating is AA!).The first thing in Chrissy Teigen\u2019s chart that is of note is, of course, her Scorpio ascendant. People born with a Scorpio ascendant are in some way seen or known for their intensity. Where that intensity goes depends on a myriad of factors. But one way to start delineating the effect of Scorpio energy is to look to the placement of Mars, which rules the sign of Scorpio. Chrissy Teigen has her Mars in the sign of Libra in her 12th house. To me, this is a set-up of secrecy. For one, it explains why Chrissy was able to get away with this type of behavior without it reaching the public. The 12H tends to rule spaces that are private or unseen. Second, Mars is a malefic force. So it is not surprising that Chrissy\u2019s own maleficence was something that was shielded from our eyes. And because it is in what is called aversion to (or, cannot \u201csee\u201d) the ascendant, sometimes the way this malefic energy comes out can be extremely disproportional. There is also something morbidly resonant about urging someone to kill themselves, when you have the ruler of your ascendant, or your embodiment, in the 12H of self-undoing\u2014especially when that ruler is Mars\u2014a planet that enjoys violence, a planet that severs and harms. Mars in Chrissy\u2019s chart is also sextile Uranus, revving up the excitement and speed with which Chrissy made her own cancellation grave\u2014off the cuff remarks and inappropriate sarcasm. Uranus also adds a certain quirk and irreverence to Chrissy\u2019s demeanor, which certainly inflames the desire to say or do things to get a rise out of others.Chrissy is 35, meaning she is in a 12H year (everyone at 35 is!), kicking up all those Mars-related issues.\u201cAs you know, a bunch of my old awful (awful, awful) tweets resurfaced. I\u2019m truly ashamed of them. As I look at them and understand the hurt they caused, I have to stop and wonder: How could I have done that?\u201dThat is a potent question to ask. When the ruler of your ascendant is in the 12H, having a sense of whiplash or delayed realization about the ways your actions have affected others is certainly par for the course. Mars is essentially, for Chrissy, operating in a blind spot.Why now? Transit Mars in Leo is in her 10H, the most visible part of the sky. Her martial mean girl behavior and other cringe celebrity-obsessed behavior is being publicized. Mars is also squaring her natal Pluto, so let\u2019s go there next.Chrissy Teigen has Pluto in Scorpio in her 1H. One of the ways that Pluto in the 1H can manifest is someone desperate to be seen as important or consequential. This is a placement that comes with a lot of power, but the way one wields that power or approaches that power or homes that power, is completely individual. In the case of Michael Costello, Chrissy essentially delighted in being able to blacklist him within the industry. That means that she was able to pull some levers in the background using her influence to derail this person\u2019s career. And that is all Pluto. In her chart Pluto is conjunct her south node, meaning that she is coming into this lifetime with some unresolved Pluto issues. In my practice of astrology, I assume planets conjunct the south node showed up maladaptively in prior lifetimes. That Christy appears to be working through this, realizing her mistakes, and apologizing, is certainly reminiscent of the growth one makes from their south node to their north node. But it is clear that she wielded that Plutonian power in less than desirable ways in the past. I also want to mention that Mars is the ruler of her Aries 6H. And so, using her energy or her power against individuals in her same industry, or in her same work environments, is extremely appropriate here. The square transit Mars is making to this natal Pluto placement sets Chrissy up for a battle of wills\u2014where on one hand she is trying to regain her public persona in the face of extreme backlash for that public persona.\u201cIn reality, I was insecure, immature and in a world where I thought I needed to impress strangers to be accepted. If there was a pop culture pile-on, I took to Twitter to try to gain attention and show off what I at the time believed was a crude, clever, harmless quip. I thought it made me cool and relatable if I poked fun at celebrities.\u201dLet\u2019s talk about those quips. Chrissy has a retrograde Mercury in Sagittarius\u2014double homicide! Not only is Mercury in detriment in Sagittarius, it\u2019s retrogradation makes things even more tricky. Mercury here is classic foot-in-mouth syndrome, where the expansiveness, boundarylessness, and affable nature of Jupiter (which rules Sagittarius), can certainly get you in trouble. Chrissy explains in the quote above and the larger apology, that she was essentially joking around. Even more, Mercury is the ruler of her Virgo midheaven. The midheaven (MC)   the highest point in one\u2019s natal chart, usually conflated with the 10H. And while the thematic similarity is there, the MC can float between the 9H, 10H and 11H. Chrissy has her MC in the 11H. The 11H can capture communities at large that share like-minded goals or interests, and for a celebrity, this house represents other celebrities. The 11th also carries connotations of social media\u2014where you can interface with a lot of people at once. Chrissy\u2019s love for Twitter is indicated here, yet so is her ultimate downfall. Those Sagittarius Twitter fingers echoing across the 11H can be problematic\u2014picking on peers, always trying to be seen as \u201cedgy\u201d or funny. You run the risk of being known for what you write (Virgo 11H), and without intention behind your words, Chrissy has become an example of our increasingly cringe public foibles\u2014post something once, it stays on the Internet forever. Her Mercury has a loose opposition to and rules her Chiron in Gemini in the 8H\u2014that she used words to mask a deep personal pain makes sense. Chiron in Gemini folks tend to have pain around communication, both as an internal complication and as an external coping mechanism. Word\u2019s hurt\u2014and Chrissy\u2019s certainly did.","title-cc":26,"title-wc":5,"body-cc":7397,"body-wc":1312,"media":0,"comments":63},"1288":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Taurus \u2600\ufe0f guilty as charged \ud83d\ude39","body-text":"","title-cc":29,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":68},"1289":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Capricorn Art <3","body-text":"","title-cc":16,"title-wc":3,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":32},"1290":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Another useful reminder of the remaining astrological events in December \u2728","body-text":"","title-cc":74,"title-wc":10,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":64},"1291":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"this beautifully illustrated wheel with keywords for the houses!

They're not. Mutable is a modality along with cardinal and fixed. There's one mutable sign for each element. Mute signs are a traditional concept based on the idea that the animals that symbolise the water signs are the only animals in the zodiac who are unable to vocalise sound and they use non-verbal communication as a result.

I nearly skipped Valentine's Day sex to be sure. When we did get pregnant I was given 11\/21-11\/24 as due date range. I was so close to a Sagittarius baby. I'd never really known a Sagittarius and was excited! Well, as babies and stars have their own agenda, little miss was born on 11\/19, a Scorpio after all.She is nearly 5, and I am sometimes very overwhelmed by her emotional range, her self awareness, and her innate shame of things that she dictates herself. But she is so intuitive. She loves absolutely boundlessly (just to a select few, but still).I am working on finding all the niche reflections of her, she is creative, devoted, delightfully macabre. She loves her sister (a Cancer. I have two pinching water babies). She is a protector, she loves using her body and testing her strength.She is a Cancer rising and Pisces moon. She loves the beach, baths, pools, buckets of water left over from the rain, and puddles. I have a theory that if I immerse her time and hobbies around as many bodies of water as possible, she will be balanced and flourish. As if she is a mermaid always trying to go home. But I always strive to make home where all her favorite waters are.I have realized she is a moon. She is patterned but predictable. She glows when full. She and the waves are connected. She dazzles those around her when she is rising.I am in awe of my tiny scorpion crescent. I have reclaimed this sign to be the magic of my own daughter. I can't wait to see what amazing things she will do.","title-cc":26,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":1546,"body-wc":294,"media":0,"comments":64},"1359":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Can any Scorpio\/8th house placements relate to this??","body-text":"","title-cc":53,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":200},"1360":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"IT'S LEO SEASON, BABY \ud83e\udd81","body-text":"Of course hyping this season up!","title-cc":23,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":32,"body-wc":6,"media":0,"comments":286},"1361":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"She\u2019s beautiful \u2728","body-text":"","title-cc":17,"title-wc":3,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":12},"1362":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Sagittarius, me, digital, 2020","body-text":"","title-cc":30,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":46},"1363":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Hope this hasn\u2019t been posted here yet","body-text":"","title-cc":37,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":18},"1364":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"ok so here's a cool cheat sheet i found..","body-text":"","title-cc":41,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":30},"1365":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Karmic reset 2020-2024 and how to survive 2021","body-text":"Astrologists have been forecasting that 2020-2024 is going to be a karmic reset of sorts for decades (I first heard about it in the '90s). All of the social and generational planets are going to be making some challenging aspects with each other through these years which will affect the entire world and affect everyone personally as well. This energy started really building back in May of 2018.Karma just means, for better or worse, whether we like it or not, things will be changing. This karmic reset will be changing everyone and everything all over the world. It will affect people differently, depending on their birth cart and what aspects their personal planets are making. It will also affect people differently depending on the decisions they make and how stubbornly they resist change.The basics:There are 5 personal planets: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars (the positions of these affect us personally)There are 2 social planets: Saturn is the planet associated with karma. It is the enforcer of the rules and laws. It is the punisher and restrictor. It also rules the structure of our personal lives, social structure, government systems, and institutions (schools, hospitals, police, and such) and disease. Jupiter is the planet of expansion (makes everything it touches bigger). It also rules the making of the laws, big business, higher education, long distance and foreign travel, and personal wealth (how you make your money)Then there are 3 generational (outer) planets: Neptune the planet of illusion, confusion, delusion, and spirituality. Uranus (the awakener) brings sudden shocks and changes. Pluto is the planet associated with renewal (death and rebirth), secrets, obsession, control, and viruses.You might see a bit of a theme since the beginning of 2020?Because all these heavy energy planets are meeting up with each other or making hard aspects with each other in the sky, we gots some major shitz happening on our planet...This current bout of heavy 2021 energy is supposed to alleviate mid March. But, what's happening right now, sets the tone for the next two years. From now until mid March all the planets are going to be \"talking\" to Saturn because of where they are placed on the wheel and how they are aspected to Saturn. Saturn is the planet of karma and that's what makes this time so karmic. Just don't get put on the naughty list right now lol!A huge part of what has been making this whole time more challenging for everyone is Neptune in Pisces. Pisces is ruled by Neptune so we've got the planet of confusion sitting in it's own sign... double confusion, illusion, and delusion. Neptune has been in Pisces since 2012 and that won't clear up until April 2025. The closer a planet gets to entering another sign, the heavier the energy gets so things are just going to get more confusing for a few more years. Why does everyone seem so crazy? Where did all these Karens come from? Neptune.","title-cc":46,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":2937,"body-wc":503,"media":0,"comments":620},"1366":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"The Cancer Archetype- Feminine Authority and a Mother's Wisdom","body-text":"Cancer is a sign that has suffered more from the historical subjugation of women than any other sign. It's a feminine sign- strike one. It's an emotive water sign- strike two. It's ruled by the Moon, the planet of women and motherhood- strike three. The same stereotypes that were designed to break down women and put them in their place are the same stereotypes pushed onto Cancer in astrology circles today- weak, histrionic, irrational, unstable, not in control of their emotions. It seems Cancer has been pegged as the weepy nurturer with not much else to offer, a weakening influence on a chart. That mindset speaks more to societies view on femininity than it does to the sign of Cancer. It seems to me Cancer is in need of a re-framing.The cardinal signs offer different brands of leadership. The forceful military command of Aries. The fair and democratic leadership of Libra. The firm and responsible hand of patriarchal Capricorn. And finally Cancer- the matriarch, the feminine authority (for whatever reason I'm picturing a circle of women on a beach beneath the Moon, tapping into their feminine power). Supportive leadership, emotionally driven leadership. Leadership that sustains and nurtures those that it directs and governs. Leadership that connects and instills a deep sense of belonging. This is the nature of Cancer and its ruler the Moon, the Queen of the heavens, beloved of her subjects. Cancer is the life-giving properties of water- water that is nourishing, enriching, life-affirming- water that rushes forth to envelop and cause everything that it touches to flourish. It is where mother ocean surges forth to meet land creating one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth, a place where life thrives. It is the creative nexus of the womb and the birth of a child into the world at the breaking of the waters- a vulnerable but powerful moment when emotions are heightened and hearts are open. This is not weakness, this is strength. To walk through the world open and receptive is potent and remarkable. To take something so vulnerable and nurture it to full strength is a feat.And this is why Jupiter is exalted in Cancer. There is nothing Jupiter cannot accomplish in the life-giving summer solstice sign of Cancer, where creative life force is in absolute abundance. It's also fair to say that for the majority of people the person that guides them, advises them, offers wisdom and support is their mother. Good mothers are the counsellors, gurus and guardians of all that they support. This is a vital and inherent (yet overlooked) quality of Cancer energy. And so Jupiter loves it, because here he has the broadest reach- you may not open up to a priest- but you will open up to your mother. And so we see the protective, guiding hand of the matriarch. Guardianship. Feminine wisdom and intuition. Emotional attunement and responsiveness. Cancer is the waves and the tides of the ocean, ebbing and flowing, pushing and pulling; ever fluctuating like the waxing and waning of the Moon. But the waves and tides are not always gentle, they can turn forceful as the mother who defends her child, as the matriarch who defends her community, as the Moon goddesses of old who were both tender and nurturing but fierce. And so Cancer shields those who need them. They take something small and vulnerable and nurture it to the point it can be delivered into the world. This could be a person, it could be an idea, a business, a creative project- all nurtured and grown, infused with genuine emotion and birthed into the world. The creative potential of Cancer is only rivalled by the other luminary sign, Leo. Together they light the world.If you made it this far thanks for reading. I hope you see how the lack of respect Cancer receives in modern astrology is unjust and is a legacy of the subjugation of the feminine. I hope this also brought some validation to people with Cancer placements who feel overlooked or poorly represented. We are not told that we are powerful, we are not told we are charismatic, we are not told that we are intelligent, we are not told that we have much to offer beyond being of service to others. So it's often a long road to learning to love our Cancer placements. I'm there now, I see how special and powerful it is, and hopefully this has helped you to do the same.","title-cc":62,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":4327,"body-wc":754,"media":0,"comments":115},"1367":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Number 8 in my Zodiac series is Sagittarius!","body-text":"","title-cc":44,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":28},"1368":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Why the fuck isn't Aquarius a water sign?","body-text":"He is literally the water-bearer.

The boar has long symbolised courage, ferocity and conflict as well as confronting life\u2019s challenges and never retreating. Boars are frequently associated with warriors and many of the Norse berserkers channeled boars in battle. The fierce independent spirit of Aries is unrivalled. \u00a0Taurus- Elephant. Gentle giants. Endurance, stability, loyalty, protection and abundance are associated with elephants, who are also matriarchal animals, fitting for a sign ruled by Venus and the exaltation of the Moon. Elephants form strong loving bonds with each other and have a responsibility over the natural world (Taurus connection to nature) due to their size.\u00a0They are the stewards of the Earth.Gemini- Parrot- Bright, quick, colourful birds. They are experts at mimicking sounds, often to comedic effect, and are highly social. They are winged messengers. They have strong associations with language, clarity, intellect, whimsy, playfulness and the power of words in speaking the truth. Above all they are fun, lively and witty. (Another good symbol for Gemini is the trickster fox- but I ultimately felt a bird was more appropriate.)\u00a0Cancer- Sea Turtle- The ancient Babylonian symbol for Cancer. Soft, gentle, tender animals with a hard protective shell (home on it\u2019s back) and the ability to move between water and land. Emotional strength is their gift as well as true understanding and guardianship. In many cultures turtles are symbols of motherhood, creation, fertility and longevity, and have long been associated with the Moon as hatchlings use the moonlight to find their way off the beach and make their way to the ocean.\u00a0Leo- Peacock- Regal, proud, ostentatious. The peacock is a well known symbol of royalty, the most spectacular of birds. Glory, confidence, vibrancy, expression and nobility come under it\u2019s associations, as well as integrity. Like Leo\u2019s you can\u2019t take your eyes of a peacock, who uses its tail feathers to impress and draw attention. In the ancient world peacock feathers were frequently engraved onto the thrones of royalty.\u00a0Virgo- Cat- Virgo is strongly associated with domesticated animals but the cat is the most Virgoan to me. Cats are astute, observant, independent, self-contained, selective, solitary and watchful. They meticulously groom and clean themselves and their owners can feel like they hate them (Virgo's resting bitch face). They can be downright mean but they secretly care underneath it all and feel the need to assist when others don\u2019t meet their standards (cats hunting mice for their incompetent owners).\u00a0Libra- Swan- A bird that is the symbol of love, grace, harmony and beauty. Swans are universally known for their elegance (they are evoked often in ballet- which is ruled by Venus\/Libra) and their devotion to each other as swan couples mate for life. Their curved necks come together to create a love heart, cementing them as a symbol of romance, union, partnership and reconciliation. In mythology the swan was attributed to Aphrodite\/ Venus.\u00a0Scorpio- Serpent- An ancient symbol for Scorpio, and one I actually think fits better than the Scorpion. A much maligned and feared creature, they are venomous and capable of shedding their old skins. Since ancient times this has led to serpents being associated with death, rebirth, transformation and the purging and elimination of the old. Poised and coiled they conserve their energy for the fatal strike. The kundalini is a strong connection between these two as well as the fact that many species of serpent are aquatic- fitting for a water sign.\u00a0Sagittarius- Wild Horse- This one is slightly cheating as Sagittarius is already symbolised by a half-horse centaur, however no animal comes close to representing Sagittarius better than the wild horse. Freedom, movement, exploration, journeys, nobility and victory. The wild horse lives without limitation or restraint, roaming under vast skies, much like Sagittarius. They refuse to be tamed.\u00a0Capricorn- Crocodile- The animal associated with Capricorn in Vedic astrology, the crocodile is ancient, hard, stern, patient, powerful, resilient and conserving of it\u2019s energy and resources. Wisdom that comes with time is attributed to crocodiles along with Saturn, Capricorns ruler. The crocodile is cold blooded, armoured and intimidating, a creature to be respected and feared. Ultimately they are built to outlast all others.","title-cc":48,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":4464,"body-wc":711,"media":0,"comments":79},"1372":{"time":"2022-02-02","title":"My take on why astrology is offensive to a lot of people","body-text":"I have been reading Cosmos & Psyche.

There's unfinished business but tread lightly. This dynamic was always unbalanced. You gave so much only to be let down in the end. Don't worry, better things are coming once you close this door. Do what you need to do in order to move forward. Don't let this connection close your heart up again. You worked so hard to open up, I promise there was a reason for it. A lesson to be learned.

You are beautiful. You are loved. Vulnerability is not a weakness.Taurus Venus\ud83d\udc97Self-sacrifice seems to be the theme here but is it really worth it? When is the last time you've felt loved? When is the last time you have felt at peace with yourself? There's a battle going on & you feel like you're drowning. The universe said, \"stand up\". When you rise again, you'll realize that the water wasn't even that high. The negativity that has been clouding your mind has caused you to have such a shitty perspective lately. Take some time to clear the negative energy. You'll be able to see through the rain soon. It's time for something new. You know that you no longer belong here, so why are you hanging around? You deserve to live a life free of fear & anxiety. Pick up some meditation or yoga, it will really help you find your inner happy place. When everything around you is so dark & scary, remember that you always have a place to hide. It's within. You are your happy place. Turn the unneccesary self-sacrificing into self-love. It looks much better on you.Gemini Venus \ud83c\udf29There's something chaotic going on around you. It's time to take a breather. This is NOT an indication of failure but something has been lost here. There's not an urgency to leave right now but something needs to change for sure. & it looks like you're gonna have to be the bigger person. I know, like always right? You know exactly what to do in order to deescalate but don't let it slide this time. Bring the situation back down to earth & then speak your mind. Trust yourself. Your intuition is on point. You're a natural born leader, that's not something to feel unworthy of. Step into your power & the universe will match your energy. What you put out into the universe will always come back.Cancer Venus \ud83c\udf08You're on the right path & it feels good. You will need to use your wisdom & discernment to help others. Ppl actually really adore you. They could benefit from hearing your story. You might feel like no one cares but that is nothing but insecurities talking. Ppl are listening, they respect you. It's your turn to venture off & find your calling. Some of you already know it, some of you are still figuring it out. Either way, you are ready. There are some things you won't be able to take with you though. Yeah, you know who\/what I'm talking about.

Saturn + Jupiter through the Houses + AFFIRMATIONS for December 21st (and beyond).","body-text":"Saturn and Jupiter meet up in the sky approximately every 20 years. The Great Chronocator, the Markers of Time, Saturn and Jupiter conjunct represent a societal changing of the guard. The last Great Conjunction was in the year 2000 in the sign of Taurus at 22 degrees, and symbolically marked a 20-year period of enhanced focus on the world economy, conglomeration of banks and corporations, making money and achieving material stability. Jupiter and Saturn have teamed up in earth signs for the last 200 years and will enter a 200-year period of meeting up in air signs. In earth, worth was\/is derived quite literally from earth via agriculture, oil, coal. Taking base metal and materials and turning them into vehicles and buildings. Humanity has been in a cycle of material building, even in smaller ways like the establishment of the eight-hour work week, labor unions, law and policy around financial reform and regulation. This is all earth\u2014the slow plod to structure a society, to structure things, plan around wealth and resource, work and reorganize, and fundamentally move in practical ways that produce tangible results. Caste, class, color, order, tradition and hierarchy are also tenets of earth, as they also aim to structure. This theme of taking from the earth and making from the earth has left us in dire straits: our trigger-haired economy, deteriorating environments and ecosystems. Demoralizing and high-stress work environments all for the check. Hustle culture. With a conjunction in the air sign of Aquarius we will (and already have) begin to see a society moving towards humanitarian causes, towards diversity of thought and idea, towards focus on fraternity, toward freedom and independence, and structure derived from a more high-minded and considered place. The demolishing and rebuilding of industries and practices that currently disenfranchise. The move towards electronic (think: solar panels, Tesla) and wind energy is a manifestation of Aquarius. So is telework, the 4-day workweek and other work\/life emancipations. And with Uranus currently in the sign of Taurus, a symbolic resonance is occurring cosmically: how we value and what we value is being revolutionized, decentralized, and radicalized.Anyway, all this high-level poetic stuff is interesting, but what does this great conjunction mean for you? The archetype of Jupiter is expansion, ease, opportunity. The road of least resistance. The archetype of Saturn is restriction, challenge, hard work. The road of most resistance. When these two planets form a conjunction two things can happen: One, Jupiter allows you to exploit and expand within given Saturnian structures and paradigms. Two, Jupiter makes very clear that you must break free of said structures and paradigms. In the former case, Jupiter works under the tutelage of Saturn\u2019s malefic energy by providing some scope and space: you may be a cog in the machine, but you\u2019ll be the best cog ever! And maybe even become your own machine one day. That\u2019s the hope. In the latter case, the machine is worn, torn, broken, and hard to maneuver. It simply doesn\u2019t work anymore but it\u2019s all you know. Jupiter provides a method of escape, like being pulled from a wrecked car with the jaws of life. Either way, you\u2019re making progress. And the foundation of this progress, its tools, lessons, successes and hardships will be a 20-yearlong theme.Find the house that the sign of Aquarius occupies for you.First House: This conjunction marks a pivotal period of identity growth for you. But don\u2019t call it a comeback. Saturn will strip away artifice, introduce you to isolation, pessimism, lack or exhaust. A building under construction often looks bare, haunted, grotesque. We see its bones and are reminded of the painstaking process of fleshing out something correctly, not quickly. Taking a deeper look at your own scaffolding, where it is weak, where it is strong, where it serves, where it doesn\u2019t\u2026is what will make your personal growth a feat worth building, something to admire from afar. With Jupiter around, don\u2019t limit yourself to the familiar blueprints. You can bend a little, you can create anew, you can paint a wall hot pink because it makes you smile. You can abandon old plots of land and start again somewhere else and will likely bump up against opportunities to do so. The selfhood you build, while requiring a hardhat and work boots, while exposing weak drywall and leaks, can also be an exercise in passion, in hope, and in personal accomplishment. You may be under construction, but you are far from over.I am my eighth world wonder.Second House: This conjunction presents the opportunity to create a life of true value. In defining the things that make you feel substantial, wealthy in ways that are material and immaterial, you will become sorely aware of the ways you have squandered your value, your worth, even your belongings. Aware of where you hold too close to the chest, where scarcity mindsets make you feel small and play small. Aware also of the mismanagement of what life has entrusted to you. It is fitting that the word currency is synonymous with money, because it hints that behind every transaction is energy. Jupiter can spark this energy, preparing buffets of riches from which you can pick and choose. But the energy behind any all-you-can-eat\/spend\/do\/make is\u2026lack or greed. In the end you are a bloated little thing. Saturn is the wisdom to pick and choose the things that are in alignment with your value systems, that match your energy, that are becoming of what you are becoming. And if necessary, Saturn will pick for you, introducing impossibly tight circumstances that can align you, once and for all, with the things that truly matter.I am aligned with what truly matters and gives meaning.Third House: This conjunction is working on your perceptions of the world, the situations that create them, and how you communicate them. Saturn creates a maturation of those little thoughts and events and comings and goings that hammer grooves into your neuropathways. Flits of this and that are to be taken seriously now. To become an expert in anything\u2014a field of study, a creative path, your mind, your voice\u2014is to be regularly tested. Do you know what you think you know? Did you say what you think you said? Your mind is being restructured, and like the first house above, the mental scaffolding laid bare invites in some chilly winds\u2014depression, discouragement, the nagging feeling of stupidity. You are no longer being insulated and comforted by patterned and habitual thought. You need to extend deeper, to say things of integrity and purpose. Jupiter can provide fill between these new structural beams by enlightening you, making higher-minded concepts a function of everyday thinking and processing. Jupiter gives you scope and space, an ability to get out of rote mental functioning and reach for something more inspiring. Jupiter is the gift of neuroplasticity, and with Saturn around, you emerge master of your message.I am master of my message.Fourth House: This conjunction is repotting you. To come into the fullest glory of yourself, you need environments that grow as you grow. A plant held hostage to a pot where its roots cannot fully extend is dwarfed in potential. Saturn transiting your fourth house feels like being uprooted, like the ground beneath your feet is shifting. Your home, your family, your tribe\u2014all various pots you hoped could contain your growth may prove cracked, worn, small. The happenings below the surface\u2014your soil, your network of roots\u2014all affect the viability of your bloom. You must tend to any garden with discipline, ready to get dirty, to encounter subterranean critters and pests. The state of your soul, your home, your domestic and private life may call for some uncomfortable pruning or care taking. That is Saturn. But like any garden, the fruits of your labor are delicious and nutritious. Your foliage becomes wondrous. Small, cracked pots give way to larger and more nurturing environments where you can expand fully into that glory. With Jupiter around, there will be no shortage of beautiful new pots. And the discernment to know where to be planted will prove to be the greatest crop you could grow.","title-cc":128,"title-wc":19,"body-cc":8249,"body-wc":1395,"media":0,"comments":131},"1413":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"A Full Moon in Taurus - October 31st, 2020","body-text":"Illumination, Revelation, Emancipation.This year on All Hallows Eve we have a striking full moon coming through in the earthy sign of Taurus. We get a Taurus full moon every year around this time, but this year\u2019s lunation is special for one very important reason: at the time of its fullness, the moon will be exactly aligned to Uranus.In Astrology, the planet Uranus has come to be associated with the myth of Prometheus - the awakener, the fire-bringer, the trickster who steals fire from the gods of Olympus and gifts it to humanity. The Promethean urge is toward illumination, disruption, freedom, novelty, and restorative justice - at any cost - all themes associated with the transits of Uranus. He is bringer of divine chaos - perturbations of the status quo for the advancement of truth and the revelation of the unseen. His presence in a configuration denotes excitement, freshness, originality and bold action rooted in the spontaneous awakening of innate genius.It\u2019s quite rare to have a full moon exactly conjunct Uranus, and thus this moment invites us to take stock and adjust our sails - that we might make good use of these prevailing cosmic winds.The Sun opposite Uranus on its own is a transit which facilitates change to personal identity - a sense of \u201cbreaking free\u201d from previously intractable personal patterns. With the full moon dynamic added, we have a sense of culmination or imminence - this particular moment could be a \u201cfinal straw\u201d situation that leads to us breaking completely new ground.Prometheus himself is a martyr figure. He sacrifices his life for the benefit of humanity - the punishment for his theft of fire is to be chained to a rock for eternity, daily suffering disembowelment by a giant eagle. We touched briefly on this myth in the last full moon report [link to last report] - Prometheus\u2019 story continues when the centaur Chiron takes his place on the stone, by way of Hercules\u2019 arrangement. We see here there is a deeper mythological weaving of these two lunations.\u00a0Thinking back to last month\u2019s full moon, some of the main themes discussed were: self-sabotage, healing, mutual reliance, and potential burnout. We talked about isolation and the renovation of the Masculine, and how the time was ripe for a deeper listening and adjustment of our habitual heroics. Since that time, we have been steadily paying attention and working with these themes.This work comes full circle now at this present Full Moon, as the Promethean link creates sudden revelations, striking developments, important realizations, and an overall sense of \u201cquickening.\u201d Whatever was illuminated last month now comes into even sharper focus and manifestation. This lunation will provoke us into tangible, results-focused actions. Important and uncomfortable conversations which tip the apple cart and force a rewriting of contracts of all kinds will be necessary.\u00a0This is a ripe moment for \u201cshadow work\u201d which has a defined goal or physical result. You may be feeling a deep stirring of previously undefined causes of cyclical problems in your life, as you grope in the darkness of your psyche for these hidden origins. With the lightning rod of Uranus in the mix, what has felt difficult to track or pinpoint could now become suddenly, and painfully obvious.","title-cc":42,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":3280,"body-wc":543,"media":0,"comments":36},"1414":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"LEO from my Zodiac Witch series","body-text":"","title-cc":31,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":60},"1415":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"There's been some debate about benefics and malefics recently and I thought I'd chime in","body-text":"","title-cc":88,"title-wc":15,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":79},"1417":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Capricorns\u2014how are ya\u2019ll doing right now?","body-text":"","title-cc":41,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":255},"1418":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Does anyone just *feel* a heightened, anxious energy in the air?","body-text":"I\u2019m still a beginner but also know there\u2019s a lot going on karmically right now.

For example, if you\u2019re a Pisces Rising, your chart ruler is Neptune (or Jupiter). A Pisces Rising tends to come off as dreamy, artistic, and gentle.The Rising Sign deals with your public self. It\u2019s who you come off as to other people. It\u2019s the glow that surrounds you. You also inherit at least 1-3 features from your Rising Sign, the rest comes from your family\u2019s genetics respectively.If any planets positively aspect your Rising Sign or sit in the 1H, those will alter with your aura and even add a bit of it\u2019s pixie dust on some of your features that your Rising Sign tends to affects the most. For example, if you\u2019re a person with Pluto conjunction Ascendant or in the 1H, you might have an air of mystery and magnetism surrounding you.Remember, if you don\u2019t fit the description of your Rising Sign, consider looking for positively aspected planets and planets that sit in your 1H! Those CAN take more willpower over you than your Rising Sign.Your Midheaven Sign\u2019s ruling planet is the second most important planet in your chart. For example, if you\u2019re a Sagittarius Midheaven, your Midheaven\u2019s ruler is Jupiter. A Sagittarius Midheaven might be best in a job that contains of comedy, a little bit of risk, and just a little bit of amusement. You might be remembered for your donations to charity, amazing performances, luckiness, etc.The Midheaven Sign deals with your career life and public image. It\u2019s who you want to be seen and remembered as. This placement is VERY important to consider if you wish to become a celebrity later on in life because what the public will see is your Midheaven Sign.If any planets positively aspect your Midheaven Sign or sit in the 10H, those will alter with your career coping mechanisms and public image. For example, if you\u2019re a person with Venus conjunction Midheaven or in the 10H, you might add a splash of beauty-relatedness into your career.

I know that modern natal astrology is one of the most popularized fields in this tradition, but it only represents a fraction of what astrology sets out to do. Astrology speaks to the overarching themes that define all things as they manifest through events and experiences. Since a chart can be cast for anything, any moment of time in the distant past or the near future, we need to understand how the various parts of a horoscope function outside of the context of human behavior and character.The signs are mediums through which the planets express their significations. Signs can either modify the expression of a planet or act as the medium through which the planet manifests. For example, planets in Taurus can manifest their significations slowly and methodically, or they can manifest them with respect to topics such as agriculture.Be mindful that the signs are being described here, not people with placements in these signs. When I say \u201cLibra does this,\u201d it means \u201cthe function of a Venus-ruled cardinal air sign is this,\u201d not \u201cpeople who have Libra placements do this.\u201d If you\u2019re visualizing these descriptions as I write them, I encourage you to visualize these traits in something like a business as opposed to a person.Aries is a Mars-ruled Cardinal Fire sign and the first sign of the zodiac. Aries is known for initiation and independence. Symbolized by the ram, Aries moves quickly and suddenly. It sprints forward without holding back, fueled by passion and inspiration. Aries is innovative, being the first to take action with the willingness to take risks. The desire to go first and be first makes Aries competitive. Its quick movements mean that it has to think on its feet and be decisive. As a cardinal sign, Aries is quick to take off but struggles to maintain its speed, leading to burnout. Aries can also decide on things too quickly, leaving no time for analysis or debates.:::Taurus is a Venus-ruled Fixed Earth sign and the second sign of the zodiac. Taurus is characterized by permanence and sensuality. Symbolized by the bull, Taurus gets things done slowly and methodically. Its pace makes it gravitate towards things that stay the same. Ruled by Venus, Taurus is concerned with value judgements, investing in things that have substance. It cultivates sensual pleasures like food, music, and wine. Though resilient, Taurus struggles with change. It clings to familiarity, oftentimes refusing to lower its standards once they\u2019ve been raised.:::Gemini is a Mercury-ruled Mutable Air sign and the third sign of the zodiac. Gemini deals with stimulation and adaptability. Symbolized by the twins, Gemini engages in dialogues with itself and absorbs information from multiple sources. Gemini wants to do everything. Its detail-oriented nature allows it to satisfy its curiosity and understand how things work. Gemini makes connections in order to find solutions. Its desire to stay stimulated can leave it scattered though. Gemini is also prone to instability and volatility, moving too quickly in multiple directions.:::","title-cc":46,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":3216,"body-wc":539,"media":0,"comments":53},"1471":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"To everyone who feels their life is in turmoil....","body-text":"There are so many people asking for chart readings because \u201ctheir life is horrible right now.\u201d I just want to say that yes everyone has their own separate issues, but the chart for the collective is crazy right now.

To read my reframing of Capricorn, Aquarius, and Gemini, visit my site or talk a scroll stroll down my post history here. :DHow did Cancer come to be synonymous with crybabies? I have no doubt, reader, that you have learned about this sign through the lens of its sensitive emotional structure. But it seems that the profound emotional wiring of Cancer has won not the recognition of its own strength, but rather, a disparagingly crafted caricature of moodiness, tears, and the girlification\u2122 of human emotion. Much like Taurus being talked about strictly in relation to food, money, and sleep, Cancer, unlike its other water sign brethren, has been loudly maligned, scorned, and joked about as if to distill this evolutionary and necessary human component down into memes about crying, hurt feelings, Drake, and mommy issues. It is true that weaponized emotion opens the door to passive-aggression, manipulation, and a particular brand of self-possessed lassitude. But then, every sign has its unproductive manifestation, not just Cancer. What is it about Cancer that triggers such a disproportionately spiteful response? Let\u2019s reframe this sign, let\u2019s highlight the strength and fortitude required to withstand the human condition with the open-heart of Cancer, and the brave act of daring to feel in a world that does not feel for us.In all of my reframings, I find mythology to be a helpful starting point. The myth of Cancer I\u2019d like to share today may have little to do with what you know. In the more popular rendition, Cancer the crab was sent to fight Hercules but ended up crushed to death. As consolation, goddess Hera made a place in the sky for the crab. End of story. But in other tellings, and instrumental in reframing this sign, Cancer was known as Crios, a giant crab that guarded Poseidon\u2019s daughters. In exchange, Poseidon gave Crios immortality. Crios took his duties seriously\u2014the protection, the sharp antennae for any danger. And so, when danger did come, Crios fought valiantly, and was left wounded. But remember, Crios was given immortality, destined to live with the injuries he had sustained, accepting of his wounded state without complaint. So, as a reward for his bravery, Poseidon relieved Crios of his pain, immortalizing him instead in the night\u2019s sky. In this second telling, we get to the heart of why Cancer\u2019s sensitivity is its greatest strength: the automatic ability to protect while enduring pain. Continuing to show up in a world that breaks our bones, rushing first to help others bandage up, while wearing a wound of their own.Cancer is a cardinal water sign, and in an evolutionary walk down the zodiac, Cancer represents a necessary first\u2014initiating emotion. It is here that all of creation\u2014started by Aries, sustained by Taurus, perceived by Gemini\u2014confronts the heart. Cancer answers the question of belonging, of community. Beyond zodiacal order, Cancer is also where life begins symbolically\u2014the womb, the life-sustaining properties of water from which all else sprouts\u2014from the relational mirroring of Libra to the experiential adventures of Sagittarius. And so the archetype of the Mother begins and ends with Cancer, the sign responsible for primordial nurturing, emotional connection, and the fundamental sense of love and care that allows one to extend fully into their humanity. Now think about how mothers are treated in society, and by extension, women writ large. There is a chronic and institutional maltreatment of the feminine: from the fight to control our bodies, to be able to vote, to be able to hold positions of power, to be able to walk home at night and not fear being followed or assaulted. Even the pathologized and pseudo-scientific ways women have been belittled\u2014from the Hysteria diagnosis of the 1880s, to the work of Freud relegating the complex (and still misunderstood) structure of the clitoris to just \u201ca small penis.\u201d Emotions have long been marred within the framework of what is weak, what is unnecessary, what is unbecoming, what needs to be shoved aside in order to succeed. In Western society, men are taught to rebuke all displays of emotions (the Cancer opposition to enterprising and stoic Capricorn). Think even of our treatment of planet Earth\u2014mother Earth. We take, we pillage, we disregard. This profound distortion of what is natural and human has leaked into Astrological takes and communities, with Cancer being the only feminine sign that takes the heat.Despite this chronic maltreatment, women continue to show up, to make strides, to give birth to the very people who may, later on, become part of the patriarchal machine. In my reframing of Cancer, I want to emphasize that continuing to show up is a fucking superpower in a world that denies the divine feminine a seat at the table, that denies emotion a seat at the table, that denies subtext, disrespects creatives, and mocks emotion. Bravery isn\u2019t winning all the time\u2014it\u2019s losing and continuing to try again. It\u2019s remaining convicted and purposeful in a world that brings you to your knees. Avoiding emotion is easy, folks. Feeling them isn\u2019t.  And to be sure, one needn\u2019t be a woman to have this superpower. Cancer energy bleeds through any gender, any culture-- but setting the stage with Cancer\u2019s undeniable link to womanhood, and womanhood\u2019s subjugation, demonstrates the power at hand here. And all this gets to the heart of Cancer\u2019s cardinal modality\u2014it\u2019s not just about initiating emotion but continuing to begin again in an environment dead set on killing you. People mock the safe space that Cancer creates, yet surely couldn\u2019t thrive without it\u2014a home, a community, a belonging, a sense that our feelings are valid. Cancer is the calling from deep in the heart that compels action. What life is worth living without that emotional compass? Sensitivity does not demonstrate weakness, but rather, points towards the strength of individuals who rise again, tender-hearted, to face the world.I also want to look at Cancer\u2019s ruling planet, the Moon, and the deep vestiges of myth that surround it. Specifically, the myth of Egyptian goddess, Isis. She was and still is considered a lunar deity, extolling the virtues of motherhood, protection, and harvest. But one of her primary powers was that of healing, another aspect of the Cancer archetype that bears importance. Isis\u2019 lover, Osiris, was cut up into a million little pieces by his brother Seth. Isis went on not only to heal and make him whole again, but to bear his child nine months later. She was revered for these skills, known as a great magician, and has been said to possess powers that were far stronger than other male deities like Osiris or Re. The moon watches over Earth when the Sun is away, casting a magical haze that gives way to dreams, to sleep, to restoration and healing. Without the reflective nature of the Moon, life is unbalanced, it burns up under the heat of the Sun. The Moon, and by extension, the Cancer archetype, provides a balanced ecosystem. With no emotional, subtextual, or subliminal exercise, the inner life suffers, and so does the outer life. Like Isis and the Moon, the Cancer energy carries with it profound healing, the ability to turn nothing into something, to smooth over what is wrought and wrinkled. In the tale above, despite the odds, the hatred, the embroiled battles\u2014Isis came to represent what it means to possess emotional wit, to circumvent challenges, to wear proudly the scars borne from protection over what is loved, what is needed, what is cared for. Is that not strength? Isis was actually a very obscure goddess but came into prominence because of her abilities. You could say she was reframed\u2014once her gifts were recognized, she was elevated in importance. Cancer deserves the same renaissance. While the sign of Cancer itself is not obscured\u2014it\u2019s gifts and strengths certainly are. Even the literal Moon, cratered from millennia of space debris, continues to rise, to wane, to wax\u2014to be alive in a hostile environment, to take the hits, just like Cancer. The Moon\u2019s presence in the night\u2019s sky, like Cancer, is enduring and resilient. It cares even when we don\u2019t.Dear reader, I hope this piece has allowed you to see Cancer differently, to see that beyond notions of crying oneself into a stupor or being a needy smotherer, that Cancer offers a profound strength, not found in any other sign. If you have Cancer in your chart, see it not as an invitation to belittle your wonderful emotional wiring or to mindlessly participate in the meme-ing of your character, but to come into respect and admiration of the superpower you possess. The world needs it, even if it does not yet see it.","title-cc":77,"title-wc":11,"body-cc":8707,"body-wc":1494,"media":0,"comments":108},"1482":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Thought you guys might be interested in this!

NASDAQ CEO just said that they are considering halting so the \"investors can callibrate\" the attack from reddit retailers.Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is tweeting how it is funny that they cry about market volatility only when the rich are bleeding, but when the crisis of 2008 happened, the banks got tax money aid, while the average joe lost his home, couldn't pay student loans and lost his job. well the average joe is buying gamestop now in solidarity with wallstreetbets. a lot of people are buying in to support the cause. fear is being replace by hate towards the broken system of fat cats. the stock is getting a gigantic gamma sqeeze this Friday to reach records high, then it will get a short squeeze next week to even higher.Hedge funds, market makers, brokers, banks and stock exchanges are going to go bankrupt. and all we have to do is endure their mind games with resolve and HOLD on selling together.Now finally my astrology take:As you all know, the age of Aquarius has just started after a millennia of age of Capricorn, couple that with the Aquarius yearly season starting as well. if this GameStop revolution is not the biggest Aquarius taking over Capricorn move I have seen I don't know what is.this will be taught in the books yet to come.what do you think, astrology wise about this?Do you think the big conjunction has a stake in this as well?

Astrology and occult studies completely changed my point of view, and once we see so much, it\u2019s impossible to unsee it, we have to carry the weight of that knowledge with us until the end of this incarnation, and maybe further on. Sure, it develops but it does not go away.It\u2019s possible we start seeing people whose chart we know through this lens; all their actions could be them acting out such and such aspect or position. Same thing with ourselves, especially when you have a lot of challenging aspects, it can seem like you have a never ending to do list of things to figure out within yourself. I often ask myself, is it possible to figure it all out or am I destined to live out all my challenging positions eventually? I know the answer is probably neither or somewhere in between and I do believe having consciousness of your chart is helpful, but it sure can feel like a lot of responsibility sometimes, or at least, a bit overwhelming\u2026All occult knowledge has its dangers because it holds a lot of power, especially if one is not spiritually ready to comprehend it, it can drive a person mad. I\u2019m still in the beginning of my studies and probably quite immature, so I don\u2019t mean to sound negative.

The North Node will move into Taurus, and the South Node will move into Scorpio. Before we get into what this means, let\u2019s address some basics. The North Node and South Node (nodes) are not celestial bodies\u2014they are mathematical points in the sky. In modern astrology, these points are linked to fate, karmic lessons, and ultimate fulfillment of a soul\u2019s desire. The nodes are always exactly opposite one another. The sign of the South Node represents archetypes that have been mastered. The sign of the North Node represents archetypes that need to be embodied and that are tied in with our life\u2019s purpose.  It is an axis of growth. Our natal charts can show us our personal nodal story, the static arc of development we incarnated into. But the transiting nodes, which change signs every 1.5 years, show us the chapter of development we are in, the areas and topics of life that are due for deeper exploration. This work is done collectively, our outer reality becoming a macrocosm of what we grapple with personally. The nodes can underscore the specific themes that confront a society, weaving into our collective development the productive and unproductive potential of a sign\u2019s energy. The signs of the nodes are the signs of the times.Think of the transiting North Node as what gains and the transiting South Node as what drains. Generally, the sign of the North Node tells us which themes can increase or get amplified. The sign of the South Node tells us which themes can decrease or need to be detached from. The sign of the North Node can provide an antidote to the distortions of the sign of the South Node, representing what we collectively need to balance and reach for. This can show up in literal and symbolic ways. For example, when the South Node was traveling through the sign of Sagittarius over the last year or so we saw a decrease in our ability to travel and a major hit to airlines because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The symbolic drain of the South Node in Sagittarius also showed up in the global spread of COVID-19 itself, limiting our freedom and sense of expansion. We were shown the distorted and scattered manifestation of ideology, policy and conspiracy, and the politicization of a global health crisis. And it was draining. The natural counterbalance is Gemini, where the North Node was during the same period. Gemini calms Sagittarius\u2019s leaps of faith with fact, clear communication, and openness to new information. Gemini is adaptable, less prone to rigidity in thought, softening the dogmatic and moralistic potential of Sagittarius. This is the sign that wants to understand the assignment. Gemini also represents our immediate surroundings, our zip codes\u2014and I think we all became intimately familiar with our neighborhoods, our towns, and our cities over the last year. Symbolically, we may have even become more familiar with our own thoughts and habits, with prolonged alone time at home prompting deeper self-reflection. And certainly, we all realized the importance of communication and socialization during a time when those things were threatened. Gemini stays in touch. Because the nodes were in mutable signs, a lot was simply in flux, the only constant being the continuous stream of change. Our flexibility was tested over the last 1.5 years, with the North Node in Gemini inviting us to remain nimble even amongst growing pressure.  Even though Gemini-Sagittarius themes are evergreen in the human condition, especially so when we have placements in either sign, the nodes made them louder as of late.What next? When the North Node enters Taurus, our collective awareness will shift towards what stabilizes, what soothes, what\u2019s secure\u2014and what just makes sense. We may find ourselves adjusting and anchoring to our new normal, finding moments of peace amid a world that is anything but peaceful. This can feel like welcome relief after a frenetic couple of years. Taurus is simple\u2014reminding us of when to eat, when to cry, when to rest, when to take a deep breath, when to move your body and how, coloring our lives with a predictability and presence that can mimic ultimate serenity. Taurus also moves towards what and who it likes and moves away from what and who it does not like, or what does not work. Over time this attunement to what the body needs, what the spirit needs, builds a life that is sustainable, providing a foundation upon which all else flourishes. Remember that the Moon finds its exaltation in Taurus, a sign that steadies emotions and makes one calm, practical and resolute in temperament. So even beyond physical needs, Taurus instincts can enter in as an internal silencing, a rejection of the needless over-complication of our lives. We can show up to the world, be of the world, but not let the world overwhelm us. Taurus cuts through the noise by remaining practical and in the present moment, simple yet elegant solutions to our complex lives. Over the next year and a half, we will be confronted with matters, personal and impersonal, that will show us where we need to simplify, where we need to rest, where our ceaseless working, striving, and psychoanalyzing has become untenable. Taurus also deals with money and with value, so we will likely continue to see massive shifts in the way that we work and in the way that we value workers, Taurus taking these ideas and making them firm or actionable in some way. The Great Resignation of 2021 will likely bleed well into 2022, with workers across the nation leaving jobs where they are undervalued, underpaid, and uncared for. The forming of unions, the fight for a living wage, growing income inequality in the wake of the pandemic, cryptocurrencies, the treatment of the environment and the basics needed for survival\u2014these are all topics that may reach a fever pitch as the North Node moves through Taurus (and especially when it conjoins Uranus). To get more specific, your natal chart can show you the exact area of life where this simplification will be occurring, the areas of life where you can find profound value by slowing down and tuning in.If the North Node provides the antidote, then naturally we find what we are healing in the South Node, which will be in the sign of Scorpio. Scorpio is anything but simple. Scorpio is a sign that goes there, a sign that makes friends with conflict and complexity by choosing to walk a path in life littered with barbwire and booby traps. Of course, this creates exquisite emotional sensitivity, discipline, and an all or nothing ruthlessness that makes warriors of men. Yet, when the South Node is in this sign, we can count on there being some dysfunction with these traits, things that need to be purged. It can show up as a maladaptive way of approaching life armor first, hurting others because we are hurt, or simply a protracted sense of woundedness or shame that keeps us stuck, unable to fully embody ourselves, our lives\u2026 our bodies even. It can also show up as that chronic psychoanalysis I spoke about above, making us savvy about our pain, yet never free of it. With the South Node in Scorpio, skeletons will find their way out of the closet and there will be a collective need to face them, to soften what is calloused and to make peace with our human indignities. You cannot be haunted by a ghost that you choose to face. Some may not want to go there. Scorpio is a sign that encapsulates the shadow of the human condition, our human condition, and looking upon what is dredged up can take guts. In response, we can find defensiveness, denial, and reactionary responses born out of unresolved pain or even trauma. Some may choose to stay stuck, unable to reach the surface of their own tangled stories, to breathe, to find shore again. Oh, and that shore? It is Taurus, fixed-Earth, land upon which you can rest and build again. This is land that remedies the tortured work of Scorpio with enduring calm, patience, and the awareness that not everything needs to be matted over and ensnarled. That not everything requires suspicion, and that not everyone is a suspect. We are being given a window of astrological time that will compel this healing, creating synchronicities in our lives, in the culture, in the world, that show us where the work needs to be done.\u201cYou work on your stuff or your stuff works on you.\u201dTo end, Venus rules Taurus, and Mars rules Scorpio. From this, we can sum up that this nodal shift will move us away from the chronic intensity, scarcity, and strife of battle-ready Mars\u2026and move us into the warmer embrace of Venus, welcomed by calm, comforts, love, and acceptance. Like all opposing signs, Taurus and Scorpio inform one another. There is no emotional intelligence and strength without conflict, without getting spurned or cut by the barbwires of life. Yet, we cannot constantly be embroiled in these dramas. Warriors need rest. Taurus enters in as that rest, as restoration, the period of peace that comes after war, allowing us to settle into, heal and understand our battle wounds. This reflection allow us to connect with that really matters and what gives foundation to our lives. As you tend to Scorpio\u2019s shadow work, remember to rest in Taurus\u2019s shade\u2014breezy, calm, and unbothered. May we all learn to claim what brings us ease, and may we find that to be enough.","title-cc":74,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":9389,"body-wc":1633,"media":0,"comments":80},"1501":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"7 Basic Astrological Rules","body-text":"Taken from Steven Forrest\u2019s \u2018The Inner Sky\u2019 (1984):\u201cAstrological symbols are neutral.

The nodal axis represents balance. You can't have one without the other. Your South Node comforts can be used to grow and develop the traits of your North Node.Again, the key is balance. Don't rely on your South Node entirely, but don't ditch it either. As an example, someone with their North Node in the 1st\/South Node in the 7th should not move away from romantic partnerships in this lifetime and activity make sure to be single. However, they should focus on their own happiness, not relying on a relationship for happiness, and entering romantic relationships that honor their individuality.2) Empty house myths-Let me very clear. Empty houses do not mean that area of life will be fucked or meaningless. I would be rich if I had a dollar for every time I have heard on various subreddits- \"omg I don't have a 7th house am I never gonna get married?!?!?\"You have all twelve houses in your birth chart, even if they are empty. Stop using Co Star or other useless table apps and you will see this. Empty houses still have a sign ruling them, and that ruler will tell you more.As an example, say Sara has an empty 7th ruled by Taurus, with Venus in the 9th. Her future wife\/husband may be a foreigner, someone she meets at her higher education or someone of a totally different cultural background than her.Furthermore, transits will have an impact on your empty house. I guarantee everyone with no Capricorn planets, but Capricorn ruling their 2nd house, surely felt the impact of the 2020 Capricorn pileup transiting.3) Venus\/Mars in Synastry and Relationships","title-cc":44,"title-wc":5,"body-cc":2007,"body-wc":360,"media":0,"comments":82},"1512":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Limbourg Brothers - Zodiac, in Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1412-16)","body-text":"","title-cc":75,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":15},"1513":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Me this Mercury Retrograde (RX) in Scorpio \u264f\ufe0f","body-text":"","title-cc":45,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":32},"1514":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Anyone else LOVE Leo energy? \ud83e\udd29","body-text":"Like yes please Sun, bring it!!!","title-cc":30,"title-wc":5,"body-cc":32,"body-wc":6,"media":0,"comments":300},"1515":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Full Moon in Cancer, 29th December 2020 at 8 degrees.

Match up the signs exactly. Now, whichever house the infographic's aquarius section (and that Mercury glyph land  -- that's where transiting Mercury is,) ***in your chart***. It will be in a different house (but same sign in everyone's charts)How to use the infographic.Note: This will be far easier if you do your chart in Whole Sign houses, but it\u2019s not required.Just pretend the chart in the infographic is yours. Transiting Mercury is in Aquarius. So, find what house that is in, in your own chart. (If using placidus, find where the last half of Aquarius is, or more precisely, where 11 to 26 degrees of Aquarius is.)Look at the infographic chart. Note that the grey highlighted areas on top of the degree numbers show what portion of each sign would be affected by this transiting Mercury. That is, the grey highlight covers from 11 to 26 degrees of each sign. If you have a planet at 4 degrees in any sign, this Mercury retrograde period will not be aspecting it. If you have a planet at 14 degrees of any sign, it will.Now, see all those aspect lines fanning out from Aquarius in the infographic chart? Those lines tell you what kind of aspect transiting Mercury is making to each sign. Think of transiting Mercury sitting in his house in Aquarius, looking out at all the other signs. Those aspects lines are his line of vision.If you have a planet in Taurus, look to see if its degree position (the little numbers next to your planet glyph on your chart) is between 11 and 26. If you have nothing in that degree range in Taurus, then you will not have an aspect there from transiting Mercury.If you do have something in Taurus, between 11 and 26 degrees, then find Taurus on the infographic chart. See the red arrow pointing from Aquarius to Taurus that says square? That tells you transiting Mercury in Aquarius is squaring your natal planet in Taurus.Just do the same for each planet in your chart. If you have something at 16 degrees Libra, then by looking on the infographic chart, you can tell that transiting mercury will make a trine aspect to your natal planet, because of the blue line labeled \u201ctrine\u201d pointing to Libra.","title-cc":104,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":2350,"body-wc":424,"media":0,"comments":61},"1535":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Continuing with the art project about each planet\/star that correlates with a zodiac sign, here's the Moon \ud83c\udf11","body-text":"","title-cc":108,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":22},"1536":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Top ~100 rappers by sun sign!

But my life experiences never seemed to match the depths of despair that these houses purportedly drag you into (at least, not yet). Dear reader, I am not here to subvert the nasties hanging out in these houses. I am not here to convince you that the 8th house can be fun or that the 12th house is a walk in the proverbial park. The 8th forms a square to the fun-loving 5th, and the 12th doesn\u2019t even see it (aversion). As a Capricorn 8th house stellium owner, and a Taurus 12th house Moon dweller, I owe it to you and to myself to be down to Earth or realistic around the energies of these houses. And realistic is a great word\u2014big blogs, accounts and Astrology websites have an incentive to reach the most people possible, which, for something as personal and subjective as Astrology, can cast a wide net that one may find themselves tangled within. And that can be okay\u2014Astrology is the art of archetypes aka symbolism and motifs that are inherently quite general. But when those generalities, like with the 8th and 12th houses, skew towards negativity, a condition that the human mind historically has a complicated relationship with, it can pollute what can actually be productive. Negativity bias is the theory that humans tend to react more strongly to and dwell on negative stimuli even when neutral or positive things are present in equal or greater amount. So, when the first 4 pages of a Google search result for \u201c8th house Venus\u201d or a Twitter thread about the doom of a 12th house Sun lean primarily negative, it can be hard to undo that association. It can be hard to be realistic about the 8th and 12th houses when much of the PR around them is histrionic, sometimes performatively so.(For some context, check out my article on the differences between the 8th and 12th houses.)Houses are simply areas of life. Astrology is sophisticated in design, with each of the 12 houses corresponding in totality with what one experiences on this ride called life\u2014relationships, work, pleasure, family, etc. Through aspect, the houses can inform one another as well, i.e., the trine from the 2nd house to the 6th house can connote money made through a job. Like with any other house, the 8th and the 12th houses come in to inform important parts of the human experience. There simply is no richly lived life without entering the domains of the 8th and 12th houses. They offer necessary pauses on our journey, necessary valleys upon which peaks can stand high, necessary breaks where the light comes in, necessary reflection that guides us forward. The 8th and 12th houses are domains of human intimacy\u2014whether with the self, another, a creation, an emotion, or the timeless and shapeless wisdom of life that I call the Universe. Intimacy here means closeness, a familiarity. And while intimacy can stoke visions of cozying up with a loved one by the fireplace, in reality, intimacy is merely our proximity to things. The 8th and 12th houses offer an intimacy that acquaints us with our faults, our longings, our complexities. To be intimate with anyone, including ourselves, there is a necessary walk through and acceptance of all our ugly and tortured bits. That\u2019s why when, for example, you share with a friend that you feel inadequate at your job, and they pull you in for a hug, the catharsis and soul affirmation is exponentially bigger in that moment than it would have been if you kept your feelings to yourself. There is a tenderness and an openness in these 8th house or 12th house encounters. They poke at our soul and remind us that we are alive, delicate, and divine. And the ability to remain pliable in a world that seeks to harden you is the very essence of human resilience.The maligning of the 8th and 12th houses, or really, the misunderstanding of them, represents a common human folly\u2014that pleasure and joy and contentedness and visibility are superior to depression and complexity and loss and isolation. But we all know the pedestrian maxim by now: sad times make the good times more\u2026good. The joy you find in the 5th house, or the wisdom you accrue in the 9th house would remain hollow if not for the soul that informs it.It is easier to deal with these houses when there are temporary transits activating them. But what if you\u2019re like me, or I assume, you, and you have a natal vortex of energy in the 8th house or the 12th house or both? Are you doomed to a life of deep soul-searching and profound but exhausting encounters? First, thanks to savvy timing techniques, your natal 8th house and 12th house planets are not active for a lifetime. Like all things in life, there is a waning, waxing and the purgatory of plateaus. Sometimes planets are just there operating in the background while some other active planetary event kicks off. That\u2019s why being realistic is an asset here\u2014life simply is not 100% tragedy 100% of the time forever and ever amen. And even amid a negative experience, a simple cup of tea or call to your mom can insert some levity, for example. Doom is simply not a nuanced take. Life is mostly gray areas. So, peeling back the negative narratives and examining your life from a sobered and practical stance lessens the sting of 8th and 12th house fortunes. I used to try and fit MY life into the narrow and harrowing write-ups for the 8th and 12th houses instead of contemplating how they fit me, how they wear on MY skin and experience. Second, no one\u2019s 8th or 12th houses are identical in manifestation. Archetypes are helpful at getting us in the ballpark, but the way the game is played is purely individual. Give yourself space to see how 8th house and 12th house things land for you. Hot take but the things that pop off in the 8th or 12th house can be benign sometimes, believe it or not. A lot of my 12th house Moon experience is just tweaking how I get the proper amount of rest. And a lot of my 8th house experience is just learning how to share. It\u2019s still work, but not as daunting!And third, a more spiritual stance: accept and learn and lean into the natal 8th and 12th house energies you possess instead of leaning away from them or hoping for a better outcome. Actively participate in your 8th and 12th house, get messy, play around in there. Do not neglect, as what you resist persists. At the end of the day, the planets in your 8th and 12th houses are parts of YOU, not some stranger. And like a machine, when one bolt or fastener is left to rust, the entire mechanism is threatened. Your fully embodied life is jeopardized when you avoid or detest or bemoan your 8th and 12th house planets. I believe every chart has a divine curriculum chosen by your soul. Avoiding the lessons or messages of the natal 8th and 12th house planets you have is a sure-fire way to flunk out and forever repeat the same courses. Life is gracious in that it graduates and changes as we graduate and change. You can do it, you can get complex, you can get deep and vulnerable, you can cry out to the Universe and hear nothing but your own echo\u2014and still rise. You have incarnated here to do 8th house and 12th house things\u2014and what a waste it would be if you let a blog bully you into fearing your own purpose, for which you came fully equipped.Your 8th house and 12th house planets make you sensitive, soulful, a vessel through which life in all its unanswered questions, hardships and intricacies can pass through, examined. And the ability to look at a thing, however grotesque and difficult, to rise to the occasion of challenge, to pull life close again and again despite how many times it has hurt you or confused you is not something to fear. It is the muscle from which magic and meaning is made.I want to end with an ancient parable that can help you think more critically whenever something in Astrology is framed as either good or bad:There once was a man who lived on a farm with his son and his horse.One day, the barn door was left open and the horse ran away. When the nearby villagers heard about it, they ran to the farm to tell the farmer how sorry they felt for him.","title-cc":43,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":8274,"body-wc":1509,"media":0,"comments":80},"1541":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Something I've noticed about Leo and Cancer.","body-text":"A lot of times I see Cancer described as heart-on-sleeve types.

Cancer is a guarded sign, very private and not willing to expose their vulnerabilities to just anyone. You have to earn their trust which is a water trait in general. So Cancer keeps up a poker face (shell) until they see something genuine or sincere or vulnerable in another person, at which point their shell drops and you see their soft, caring side which feels great.

I believe that Taurus is the kindest and loyalest sign out of the zodiac, and they\u2019re very caring as well. Taurus offers a stable support system that you can certainly rely on, they always offer a hand to those they care about. They\u2019re great at advice, and can help you see the beauty in life\u2019s most difficult situations. They will always be there to encourage you to keep pushing forward even when your life seems to be getting off track, and they do this in a very gentle, caring and nurturing way. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be friends with them you\u2019ll know that they offer a ride or die type friendship, and they will always be thoughtful of you. You will also be aware that the stereotype of them being boring is far from true, they will surely have you entertained even in the most mundane situations. They are as loyal as they come and will not only fend for you in your presence but in your absence as well.

IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE PLACEMENTS LIKE I DO, PLEASE DO NOT DESPAIR. THERE ARE MANY MANIFESTATIONS OF PLANETARY ALIGNMENTS, AND MANY ARE POSITIVE OR NEUTRAL.)You\u2019ve seen the meme going around. The one that tallies up infamous serial killers and their Sun signs. The result? A heap of mutable signs. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. I\u2019m tired of the slander! Jokes aside, it does seem to perpetuate harmful stereotypes, especially for Gemini and Sagittarius (or Sagiterrorist as Twitter says---yikes) ,that there is something inherently dubious, untrustworthy or sinister about these signs. So here is a brief examination of all 12 signs, the infamous killers who belong to them, and the planetary conditions that can compel heinous acts. That\u2019s right, murdering is equal-opportunity and doesn\u2019t discriminate based on sign. Leggo!Aries: Donald Harvey, born 4\/15\/1952. Killed 37-57 people while working as an orderly. Method: mostly poison. RX Mars in Scorpio square Pluto in Leo. Mars in the 8th, Pluto in the 5th. Poison, a rather passive way of killing someone, can belong to a RX Mars in Scorpio, and the perverse pleasure from such acts can belong to Pluto in the 5th. ASC ruled by this Mars, out of aspect to the ASC\u2014suggesting a hidden, unwieldy martial nature. Tense aspects between Mars and Pluto can manifest\u2026darkly. He also had Neptune opposite his Sun-Jupiter conjunction in the 1st. Neptune can destabilize the ego, create low self esteem, and produce disturbing fantasies, especially here with a sextile to Pluto. Uranus in the 4th in Cancer is the apex of a T-square, with the opposition between his Sun-Jupiter and Neptune, both of which square Uranus. Acting out in erratic and disturbing ways whilst taking care of people in a place they call home (Uranus-Cancer-4th). Harvey said he killed out of empathy, wanting to end others\u2019 suffering, or out of anger. Jupiter conj Sun in the 1st in Aries can create a hot-head whose anger gets out of order (Jupiter expands)  very fast. Harvey also had tense aspects from his Venus to his Moon and from his Venus and Mercury to Saturn. Unloved, a hardened love, loss of confidence. Moon in detriment in Capricorn.Taurus: Albert Fish, born 5\/19\/1870. Killed 3, confirmed. A suspected 9-100 others. Method: variable, but sexual in nature. No time of birth and therefore no rising sign. Mars conjunct Pluto in Taurus. So we are sensing a Mars-Pluto theme. In the fleshy sign of Taurus, this conjunction unfortunately manifested as a fascination with genitals and sexual mutilation. Mars can be our sex drive, and Taurus is a carnal and physical sign, concerned with the body and physical pleasures. Pluto adds the darkness and obsession. Fish also mutilated himself, sticking several needles into his, uh, pelvic region. Mars in Taurus cuts into the flesh. Fish said that he felt God was compelling him to torture children. His Capricorn Moon was opposite his Uranus in Cancer, disturbed rationale on the idea of taking care of children. Here, Venus was also square the Moon, conjunct Neptune, and square Uranus. His prevailing sense of value and love was disillusioned by Neptune (feeling directed by God, a higher force) and completely abnormal (Venus sq Uranus). He was apparently nicknamed The Moon Maniac because he struck at night. Weirdly enough, the Moon exalts in Taurus. Not astrologically relevant but ironic.Gemini: I feel like I should skip this re: the meme alluded to above. So many to choose from\u2026Uh\u2014David, \u201cSon of Sam\u201d Berkowitz, born 6\/1\/1953. Killed 6. Method: stabbing and shooting. I know you\u2019re wondering by now: what are Mars and Pluto doing in his chart? Well, they\u2019re in a softer sextile, Mars in Gemini and Pluto in Leo. But Mars is conjunct Mercury in the 8th and trine Neptune in Libra in his 12th. He famously suggested that he was under the influence of a demon dog while at the time of the murders, feeling compelled to carry out these terrible acts because of this voice in his head. This is the seamless conversation of Mars (aggression) Mercury (your mental processing) and Neptune. He made up a fantastical lie, probably to be declared mentally incompetent. The 8th and 12th houses are also a fitting arena for stories of demons, possession, killing and other otherworldly phenomena. Berkowitz enjoyed the publicity he got from his crimes, perfect for an 8th house Gemini stellium and for a Leo MC. He also enjoyed writing letters to the police, taunting them. Gemini loves a cat and mouse game. Sadly, this was a disgusting one. He mostly victimized women, perhaps owing to a fallen Venus in Aries opposite his ascendant, Neptune and Saturn. This is also the 3rd serial killer in a row to have Moon square Venus, an infelt tension between his emotional gratification and the principle of femininity.Cancer: Genene Jones, born 7\/13\/1950. Killed 2. A suspected 60 others. Method: poison. No birth time. Jones was a nurse in the pediatric unit of a hospital. And so yes, all of her victims were infants and children, fitting for a Cancer Sun. She also had her Moon, Mercury and Uranus in Cancer, with Uranus in a tight conjunction to her Moon. This goes without saying by now but pretty erratic emotional nature. Mars was conj Neptune in beauty-loving Libra, and Jones worked for a time as a beautician before becoming a nurse. This combination later ended up producing a woman who murdered (Mars) but injecting lethal amounts of drugs (Neptune) into her patients.Leo: Luka Magnotta, born 7\/24\/1982. Killed 1 human, several animals. Method: suffocation, decapitation, severing and stabbing. No birth time. Subject of the new Netflix docu-series: Don\u2019t Fuck With Cats: Hunting An Internet Killer. Magnotta had Sun conjunct Mercury in attention-seeking Leo. He tried out for many reality shows, was a porn actor, and portrayed his life online as a jet-setting model and socialite. He had several fan pages on Facebook, with almost all the comments praising how beautiful he was. It later surfaced that he created all these fan pages, wrote all the comments, and doctored images with his face on other people\u2019s bodies to give the illusion of a glamourous life (His Sun-Mercury conjunction is square boastful Jupiter). His Moon was in shy, calculated and sometimes cold Virgo, square Neptune, embedding within his emotional life a perverse kind of dreaming and wanting. His emotional nature was at odds with his Leo Sun, setting the ground for a person who needed to find attention in a less obvious way. Oh and yes, here he had a Mars-Pluto-Saturn conjunction in relationship oriented Libra, sextile his Neptune in Sagittarius. Mars and Pluto square his Sun\u2014a magnetic, forceful, lustful, and aggressive personality, an ego bent on control and perverse desire. All 3 malefics in Libra show that relationships would never be easy for him, owing also to his Virgo Moon, which can view emotional satisfaction as a struggle. Magnotta uploaded videos on YouTube of him murdering kittens, never showing his face (Virgo). This is how he ended up filling the dark desire of his Leo Sun: he got A LOT of attention. Later on, he also uploaded a video of him killing a Chinese man studying abroad in Canada. He had Uranus trine his Sun-Mercury conjunction in Leo. That he used the Internet to display the attention-seeking needs of his Leo Sun is no surprise.Virgo: Paul Bernardo, born 8\/27\/1964. Killed 4. Raped 13. Bernardo was known as The School Girl Killer which off the bat is an eerie coincidence for a Virgo Sun and Rising. If there is anything that conjures up the innocence and purity known (kind of stereotypically) for Virgo, it is the archetype of the school-girl. He has Mars exactly conjunct Venus in Cancer, and trine Neptune in Scorpio. His first rape was against his sister in law and aided by his wife. So, grossly, it was a family affair, the domain of Cancer. Neptune brought in the element of drugs and alcohol\u2014Bernardo drugged his wife\u2019s (Karla) little sister with rum and sleeping pills, and took advantage of her when she passed out. Mars conjunct Venus can indicate violence against women. But strangely, in Bernardo\u2019s case, it also represented that he carried out many of his crimes with his wife by his side. This theme continued\u2014where Karla would bait the victim and drug them, and Bernardo would assault them. Bernardo\u2019s Mercury, Pluto and Uranus were involved in a tight conjunction in Virgo in the 1st, opposite Saturn in Pisces in his 7th. His identity to the world and within relationships was wrought with control, obsession, restriction, and darkness. He frequently boasted about his sexual prowess, experience and preferences\u2014a signpost of compulsive Pluto defining the personality from the 1st. His wife Karla (Taurus) had the same Mars conjunct Venus aspect in her chart and Pluto conjunct Bernardo\u2019s ascendant, fueling his sexual appetite. Bernardo\u2019s Mars conjunct Venus fell in Karla\u2019s 7th house of relationship. They also both had Moon in Aries conjunct, solidifying the sordid theme of Mars in both of their charts. This is the story of a fated relationship intertwined with the ominous themes of death, sexual gratification and predation.","title-cc":70,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":9442,"body-wc":1624,"media":0,"comments":52},"1548":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"I thought you guys would appreciate my astrology stickers that I designed! \ud83d\udcab","body-text":"","title-cc":76,"title-wc":12,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":25},"1549":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"\u2b50January 2021 Astro Summary\u2b50","body-text":"","title-cc":28,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":16},"1550":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Taurus - Zodiac Collection, Mixed media illustration","body-text":"","title-cc":52,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":30},"1551":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"This is what being a Virgo\/earth moon is like","body-text":"","title-cc":45,"title-wc":10,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":102},"1552":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Planetary movement visualized 2 ways","body-text":"","title-cc":36,"title-wc":5,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":0,"comments":14},"1553":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Has this week been just the most draining week or was it just me?","body-text":"I\u2019m pretty sure. there\u2019s something up with the stars above.

JUPITER","body-text":"Click bait title. Sorry about that.But I want to explore, astrologically, what in the hell has been imploding in Ellen's life to completely reverse this \"be kind\" public image and replace it with an image of a person who seems to be callous, treat people poorly, and stage traps\/jokes\/scares for her own shits and giggles.To be clear, I don't think there is anything inherent about Ellen's placements that suggest an ironclad route down the mistreatment-of-others road. A potent mix of power and platform can really distort planetary energies, making them rear in gnarly ways.Let's talk about the dark side of Jupiter energy. Ellen is a Pisces Ascendant. And it feels odd, right? The sensitive and compassionate fishy capable of wrongdoing? Its ruler, Jupiter (traditionally), can manifest in problematic ways--grandiosity, hubris, dogmatic thinking, etc.  A user posted here about a year ago (hi Sean!) about a Purdue University study done tracking the birth information of KKK members. There was a staggering amount of Sun in Pisces members--40%. (The rest of the 60%--Cancer, Scorpio and Capricorn).And while the Sun sign isn't everything, and I'm not even talking about Ellen's Sun, it illustrates a disturbing point about Pisces and its ruler--the real potential to proselytize, to go overboard with belief, to crusade for conversion of thought or practice, to become a zealot, moved  by the \"idea\" of something noble versus the actual practice of it. Jupiter is also the principle of teaching others. And placed in a position of power, teaching becomes preaching. Give Jupiter a massive audience and it can really get high on its own supply. Jupiter is the televangelist.Yes--I know Ellen was not trying to convert in the traditional religious sense. BUT--she was rather committed to this \"be kind\" front,  performing tolerance, giving away checks and prizes, and virtue signaling--while the actual human beings employed by her were suffering (allegedly).  Jupiter and Pisces so moved by the idea of compassion and kindness, creating a platform and celebrity around it (1st house), yet failing to actually practice it intentionally. It reminds me of famous preachers who do questionable and selfish things with their millions, whilst preaching every Sunday about charity to others. Much is said of the Pisces escape into substance, romance and art--but Pisces can also escape into unreality. That is where the dissonance between what you \"talk\" and what you \"walk\" creeps in. Pisces can also tether itself to spiritual superiority, which is just a front for Jupiterian arrogance.For what it is worth, Ellen's producers are shouldering a lot of the blame about the toxic work environment, saying that Ellen was removed from the day-to-day running of the show. And that's Jupiter too--holding up a front and neglecting details. She appeared to be surrounded by Yes-men, and that too is Jupiter--a king\/queen on its throne assured that the kingdom is running well.Ellen's Jupiter (and Neptune) also trines her Pisces ASC. That means Jupiter effortlessly steers her ship. The sneaky trine! You never notice it. Like an inborn trait, a second skeleton. While this obviously made her generous, successful, a benefactor to many, it also provided a seamless route for Jupiter and Neptune delusions to creep in. Acting without accountability. Poor humor disguised as gregariousness. Misplaced enthusiasm. Arrogance. A former employee was allegdely told never to look Ellen in the eye or to say hello first, \"but don't worry, Ellen won't ever be saying hello to you.\" Yikes.While her producers are taking some blame, many employees have already come forward to say that Ellen's pranks and jokes created a tremendous amount of stress. With her Jupiter in Scorpio, she can use her sense of humor to provoke people, to take it all the way to the edge of what is okay. She famously scares a lot of her celebrity guests, finding out their worst fear (i.e. spiders or clowns) and using that against them for a thrill. It pretty macabre. And while a lot of celebrities have come to her defense, the laymen behind the scenes were subject to Scorpio toxicity, an environment of racism, sexism and inappropriate harassment. While Ellen cannot be blamed for all of these occurrences, some perpetuated by producers and management, it says something about her Scorpio footing--there is a sense of drama, and crisis and complexity always prevailing. Even her coming out as gay and suffering the fallout from that back in the late 90s corroborates this Jupiter in Scorpio narrative of controversy, and transforming through it.Jupiter also rules her Sagittarius MC, and without beating a dead centaur, this really just rounds out the strength of Jupiter in her chart, and how it is performed and perceived by the public. It has a high stake in her personality and career.","title-cc":46,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":4851,"body-wc":814,"media":0,"comments":120},"1566":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Moon conjunction Jupiter today","body-text":"","title-cc":30,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":52},"1567":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"1 in 5 Americans Consider Their Child's Potential Zodiac Sign When Planning a Pregnancy, Survey Says","body-text":"Would you do this?I\u2019m currently trying to get pregnant and would never time my conception to get a specific sign.

It can\u2019t be sextile, trine, square, or opposite.Semi sextiles can be soft aspects and semi squares can be hard. They\u2019re just a little less powerful.The influence of the sun and the respective planets aspecting it is a factor when describing the aspects between them. If your Sun isn\u2019t that powerful, and your moon isn\u2019t either, then the description for the Sun-Moon native is probably not going to be accurate.With that being said, in most cases, the Sun is easily the most influential planet in astrology when it comes to your innate personality. If you\u2019re not at least a little like your Sun sign, you are a rare case.Conjunctions can either be an easy aspect or a hard aspect because they are the purest blend of both planets. They take in both the negative and the positive traits of both planets and mix them together. It\u2019s up to the native to work hard on themselves and make it a soft aspect.While most of us express our Sun sign\u2019s traits to a certain extent, the men have an easier time doing it, along with their Mars sign\u2019s traits. Women have an easier time expressing their Moon and Venus signs.I like to add my opinions here and there to make it more fun to write for me so don\u2019t take it personally if you don\u2019t like what I say. ....\u2026....................................................................................Sun-Moon adds a lot of emotions to your personality. Soft aspects (trine, sextile, potentially conjunctions) make you more in touch with your emotions, whereas Hard aspects (square, opposition, potentially conjunction) make you hate and try, but fail miserably, to reject these emotions, resulting in more negative emotions. The good aspects can also mean a good relationship between the parents, while the bad aspects mean there could be a rocky relationship. Sun-Moon natives\u2019 health could be dependent on their moods. The female native could possibly be seen as somewhat fatherly because they can express their moon sign a lot more easily than other women without this aspect, making them seem more initiating. The male native can have some motherly traits. Sun-Moon natives are family-oriented. They love their Moms more than anyone else. The father figure was possibly a Cancer or had some of the Moon\u2019s influence in his chart. The father figure was perhaps the native\u2019s mother too. The father figure nurtured the native and attended to the natives feelings. The father figure probably stayed at home and cooked and cleaned.","title-cc":33,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":2760,"body-wc":475,"media":0,"comments":76},"1608":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"Mars conjunct the Lunar Eclipse","body-text":"","title-cc":31,"title-wc":5,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":11},"1609":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Ahh sweet mercury retrograde \ud83d\ude2d anyone else feeling the effects?","body-text":"","title-cc":63,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":70},"1610":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Tree of life inspired by astrological chart","body-text":"","title-cc":43,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":21},"1611":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Cancer witch from my zodiac witch series","body-text":"","title-cc":40,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":28},"1612":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"What are birth charts gonna look like once humans start being born in other planets","body-text":"I was wondering how our conception of astrology is gonna have to evolve once humans are born in other planets, maybe is not gonna happen soon but it does make me really curious.

This is actually quite a constructive and purposeful lunation, and so it's worth feeling into and translating its energy into your own life. Ruling it is Mars in Aries, which has completed two-thirds of its \"renovation\" process it has been in since the start of July this year. This is a potent and positive omen, as Mars actually goes direct just the day before, on Friday the 13th.With Mars direct now and ruling this New Moon, we can look forward to the resolution and reversal of issues that have been long plaguing us with their incompleteness. Mars Retrograde since mid-September has brought delays, rethinks and immersive confrontations with our own willpower, and the limits thereof. Over the past two months, we've been especially challenged in whatever area Aries rules in our charts, by whole-sign house. For example, if you've got Cancer rising, Mars Rx has been in your 10th whole sign house, during which time you've probably encountered necessary but aggravating obstacles to your career and vocational life. You can expect these blockages to begin shifting now - slowly at first, and then gradually gaining momentum.Generally speaking, these delays and setbacks will have been for the better, even if during the retrograde, we felt blocked or like we were giving 200% effort for 50% of expected results. While this energetic upgrade will still take until mid-February of 2021 to fully complete, the grinding, raw frustration should start to ease up now. We can expect things to begin happening at a quicker pace, to get answers, and to see some germination of the seeds we've been trying to coax to life.The actual New Moon itself is configured in a flowing way to the current stellium in Capricorn - Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto - which have been creating so much systemic upheaval, fear, catharsis and dark rapture over 2020. It has been one of \"those years\"  - one which history will remember for a long time to come. However, at this New Moon we have a window of opportunity to begin making sense of these shifts in a new way. Emotional integration, deeper alignment, and making firm decisions based on trust are all in the mix.The idea of \"being sure\" of something - not from the head so much as the gut - is a key Scorpio frame. Coupled with that is the idea of \"investment\" or of something being worthy of our full commitment. Scorpio shoots from the hip and is all or nothing, and at this New Moon we can begin to see where \"going all in\" could pay off down the line. Of course, this requires a process of checking in with our own integrity at crossroads moments - indeed, the image and feeling of a crossroads is strong at this New Moon.While there are still numerous challenges to be faced in the coming weeks and months, this New Moon signals a relative turning point. It does not denote miracles or sudden graces, as the moon is in Fall in Scorpio. The movements of this lunation are likely to be more privately felt, intimate, personal and introspective, the results of which will play out over the next 6 months until the Full Moon in Scorpio on April 26th, 2021. That Full Moon acts as a bookend for this process we are about to begin, and promises earthy, tangible results through our deep work and shadow processes.This is a fantastic time to embark on an analysis of your patterns of holding back, control, obsession, deep desires, and especially, unconscious fears. How do you really feel right now about x or y? What is driving you forward, or pushing you from the rear? Often in life it is so hard to tell the real answers to these questions. You may think you know how you feel, but actually feeling it is another matter. Getting clear about your true motivations at this New Moon will help create the momentum you need to move through these next 6 months, but it's a process that requires a different level of intimacy and attention.This New Moon moment could include revelations of its own that serve as a starting gun for this process of searching. Mercury is finalizing its oppositions with Uranus, as well as its own Retrograde period which was fairly chaotic. Watch for big reveals and flashes of insight this weekend. Also important is Venus, which makes superior squares to the Capricorn trio, highlighting again our search for justice and due process in both our personal and public lives. Now would be a time to make a plan for the next months - a strategy that is both rooted in your own \"truth,\" as well as being ruthlessly pragmatic. Now would not be a time to play games with yourself - call your own bluff if you've been stalling out on something critical.","title-cc":41,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":4726,"body-wc":832,"media":0,"comments":31},"1617":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Astrology validates your path and the way you think.

It is giving us the opportunity to take up space and respect our own wishes, without feeling guilty or selfish. We can begin to feel less obligated to being convenient to others at the expense of our own well-being.Mars in Gemini seems so argumentative on this moon, but maybe its to finally stick up for ourselves in someway.

In the Northern Hemisphere, Pisces and Aries (which are at the ends of the spectrum) rise for the shortest amount of time, contrary to the longest, Virgo and Libra, due to the Earth's axis. Wikipedia says that in Paris in France for example, Virgo and Libra rise for 2 hours 45 minutes, whereas Pisces and Aries only 1 hour. Even further north, like St Petersburg in Russia, it's 3 hours 20 minutes for Vir\/Lib and only 35 minutes for Ari\/Pis. Over there there would be so many less babies born under Ari\/Pis ascending signs (doing the maths: 14% born under Vir\/Lib each, 2% under Ari\/Pis).In the Southern Hemisphere it's of course the other way round - Pisces and Aries rise for the longest time, and Virgo and Libra the least - so more babies born as Ari\/Pis ascendants. However considering that 90% of the world's population is in the Northern Hemisphere, that overall makes Pisces and Aries the rarest of them all. Also when looking deeper in the geography - the most populous country in the south is Indonesia, which itself is very near (and in fact at) the equator - thus the differences aren't that big. The most significant populous cities\/regions in the south (that are distant enough from the equator) are around the 20-35\u00b0S latitude mark. In the north meanwhile, most of the largest places\/countries are already at least 30\u00b0N: like China, USA, Pakistan, Japan, Egypt, Italy, Turkey, France etc. (and many of these are over 40\u00b0N, including NY and Chicago). And at 50\u00b0N and over the likes of England, Germany, Russia etc.This points that overall in the world, by quite a shot, Virgo and Libra ascendants are each the most common, whereas Aries and Pisces ascendants are the least.","title-cc":47,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":1795,"body-wc":320,"media":0,"comments":202},"1649":{"time":"2021-12-04","title":"Basic Descriptions for the Houses in Astrology","body-text":"Almost two months ago, I made a thread with some basic descriptions for the signs of the zodiac. I got a lot of positive feedback on that post, and since a few people asked me to make another one on the houses, I decided to get that done today. Houses are one of the four pillars of astrology alongside planets, signs, and aspects, but they\u2019re often watered down or disregarded when discussed in popular content. While I would like to jump right into describing each house, I think it\u2019s important to talk about what the houses are before I list what they signify.Houses are the regions of the local sky \u2014 both above and below the horizon \u2014 that the planets are located in. While the zodiac shows us where planets are in space relative to the Earth, houses show us what parts of space are visible in the sky at a given time and location. Just as there are twelve signs of the zodiac, there are twelve houses, and all twelve exist in a horoscope.Houses represent lived experiences, topics, and other people or entities with respect to whatever a chart is studying. In natal astrology, a house can represent you, your mother, your partner, your job, your environment, your beliefs, and more. It can represent experiences of gain and loss, sickness and health, publicity and solitude, and so on. When we interpret a chart, we focus on a house to center a certain experience. Then, we assess the planet ruling that house and the planets in that house to determine the qualities of that experience and when it\u2019ll play out in someone\u2019s life. This is why houses are so important in astrology. Without them, you can\u2019t determine where a planet is being expressed.One of the most important things to understand about the houses is their rationale. While there are some overlapping significations between different signs and houses, houses do not get their meanings from the signs. This sign-house conflation \u2014 commonly known as the ABC model or the twelve letter alphabet \u2014 was developed in the early 20th century following the revival of astrology. It changed how we understand the houses in modern times, and it ultimately doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re delineating a chart using techniques. Houses get their meanings from a number of interacting factors, including diurnal rotation, angularity, aspects to the ascendant, planetary joys, their relationship to other houses, and more. Signs are not involved in that process.I bring this up because there will be some common significations you won\u2019t see on this list along with some new ones you\u2019ve never seen before, and it\u2019s important to understand why certain house topics are or aren\u2019t there. I can\u2019t give an extensive breakdown of every single house and why it signifies what it does, but I\u2019ll do my best to introduce each house\u2019s classifications and some of its rationale before I describe what it means.The First House (Helm) is an angular house and the Joy of Mercury. It\u2019s where the sky and earth meet at the eastern horizon, marked by the Ascendant. The Ancient Egyptians noted that the east is where the Sun rises and thought that it was an auspicious direction, signifying birth and life in general. This house is often described in modern astrology as being a \u201cmask\u201d or a persona, but it traditionally represents \u201cyou\u201d as a whole in character, physicality, and vitality.Associations: Us, our bodies and physical health; our character\/personality\/psychology.:::The Second House (Gate of Hades) is a succedent house that forms no aspect to the ascendant. The second house is beneath the horizon, and planets in this house are moving towards the first house. Houses beneath the horizon generally have more physical significations, and succedent houses are often thought to \u201csupport\u201d the angle that they\u2019re approaching. Thus, the second house signifies the resources that support us. This is traditionally considered one of the \u201cbad houses\u201d due to its lack of an aspect to the ascendant, but out of the four bad houses, it\u2019s ranked as the better of them. I\u2019ve seen \u201cself-worth\u201d used as a signification for this house, but I think that works better for the first than the second.Associations: Our finances, income, assets, possessions, and property; Our spending and saving habits; Benefactors in our lives; Gifts that we receive from or give to others.","title-cc":46,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":4294,"body-wc":748,"media":0,"comments":49},"1650":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"ANNOUNCEMENT: We are implementing temporary member rules during site-wide Reddit attack","body-text":"UPDATE: We are lifting the temporary Approved User requirement.

Doja Cat and Lana Del Rey","body-text":"These two women have been in the news lately for questionable behavior on social media, both with allegedly racist undertones. I'll leave the judgement and the specific goings on up to you readers, but the general taste these women have left in the public's (and their fan's) mouths has been sour. To say the least.Because this is all playing out in GRAND, FLAGRANT form, I was like \"huh. wonder what Venus RX is doing to them.\" Also--the changing of the nodes. These are some dramatic cosmic changes that can flip the script. Two women, adored, one breaking records--and now their reputations are in jeopardy.I also rarely work with Lilith, but coming fresh out of a lecture about sex in the natal chart, I'm easing into incorporating it into my work. And both of these women have Lilith playing out prominently here.For female music artists, no doubt Venus plays a heavy role, just archetypally. But these women specifically have strong Venus. Lana has her Venus on an angle in the 7th in Taurus, directly opposite her ASC and conj NN and Lilith. And Doja is a Libra Sun and NN. The latter does not have a birth time, so I did a noon chart for her. The former has a chart rated A.Are these strong Venusian women unwitting victims of Venus RX?Lana with NN conj Venus conj. Lilith in a Venus-ruled sign, playing out in the house of others makes a strong case for a woman whose sexual prowess, art, and carnal musings are RIPE for public consumption and opinion. In one IG post she lamented \"when FKA Twigs gets on the pole it's art, when I do it, I'm a whore.\" Paraphrasing. Lana, in brief, has become fed up with her own sexual image being disparaged while the sexual images and creations of other women are being praised. With Lilith, this will be a constant issue. Madonna vs. Virgin Mary, whore vs. nun. Other strong Lilith celebs are Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian--both women whose sexuality hits a nerve in the zeitgeist and seem to transcend what is viewed as ok or normal. Lilith triggers. That's her job.Venus RX is in Lana's 8th house, opposite her natal Uranus in Sag. Mercury is also currently in Gemini with the same opposition. The suddenness of her message is apparent in this transit. Her call for over an overhaul of her image is very Uranus, wanting to break free and forge a new path. Stunningly, and finishing out the theme, transit Uranus is in her 7th house, moving towards a conj. with her Lilith, Venus and NN. Venus RX in the 8th can call for a deeper reexamination of our sexual lives, our intimate places, and for Lana, how she is \"embodied\" by being in love, even if the relationship explores darker themes of abuse, imperfection and submissiveness. Gemini the messenger as her 8th gives her messages a sordid, deep, and here, sexual sort of tint. But playing out in aversion to her Scorpio ASC, it is not always in the best interest of how she is seen and perceived. AKA damage control. But the NN traveling through this house will compel Lana into an air of independence and forward-facing deep diving around these issues.Doja's foibles, though not identical, also harp on issues of sexuality and race. Though less reliable in a way, her Unknown Time\/Noon chart has similarly compelling themes. First, Doja has natal Jupiter in Sag. That her ascent into stardom after years on the hustle coincided with Jupiter's foray into Sag last year is no coincidence: Jupiter Return. Cardi B and Meg Thee Stally had it too. Doja has natal Lilith in Gemini, which makes sense given she explores her sexuality online (has a song appropriately called Cyber Sex) in chat rooms, completely running through every social media platform that is available to her. It helped her connect to her fans, but has now also led to her downfall--as her overtly sexual and allegedly racist behavior in these rooms has caused her star to dwindle. Her Lilith squares her Saturn, bringing in themes around father and patriarchy--though not our place to speculate, her father (south African movie star) was not in her life, leading some to draw the conclusion that her oddly sexual internet behavior was due to an absentee daddy.You guessed it, RX Venus is conjunct her natal Lilith, coinciding with this theme of reversal around previously habitual (Gemini) sexual behaviors, and a fall from grace on the internet (Gemini). Also, and exhibitionist nature with her sexuality, her body, and beauty.With her Noon Chart, Doja is a Sag Rising, making Gemini her 7th. Like Lana, her 7th house Lilith and the Venus RX action in Gemini causing the public to cast their stones, appropriately or not. Sag ASC places Doja's Libra in the 11th, which is persuasive, given her complete charm and genius when it comes to exploiting all internet platforms for visibility. A Sag ASC is also curiously, if not sadly, appropriate here given that the SOUTH NODE is now there conjunct her ASC. A serious cycle of reckoning with how you come off to the world, learning to rein in unwise independence\/selfishness, and truly coming to learn how to consider the other, and who you let into your orbit. It's also a time of maturation around 7th house pursuits like management and PR, the people responsible for Doja's image and allegedly the pen behind her recent apology.","title-cc":49,"title-wc":11,"body-cc":5244,"body-wc":928,"media":0,"comments":44},"1652":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Instead of roasting each other lets empower each other!

Though, there are nuanced differences between them. They are talked about in such strong tandem that the 8th and 12th house appear to offer us the same things: hardship, challenge, spirituality, meditation, death, loss, the occult. All things immaterial, woo-woo, psychic or magical. The 8th and 12th trine one another, but then so does the 4th, yet the 4th is largely left out of the conversation. More on that another day (sorry 4th). Below is what I find to be the difference between the 8th and the 12th, both as a personal holder of planets here, and from client work.The 8th house is where we enter into complexity, basically. Whether it is the complexity of the finance market, the complexity of mental health and trauma work, the complexity of occult work or the complexity of marrying or going into business another flawed human\u2014nothing in the 8th house is clear cut. Where the 12th house offers us a similar kind of transcendence, dissolving into nothing\u2014the 8th house is where we dissolve into our own humanity. Not through the more comforting gaze of spiritualism or meditation like the 12th, but through a human willingness to \u201cgo there\u201d. And so, to me, the 8th house requires some action. We can perhaps see this in that fact that the 8th house sextiles both the 6th house and the 10th house, the sextile being a more active and energizing current. The 6th is where we go for daily, ritualistic work. It is where we go to hone in on the details of daily life in such a way that galvanizes personal success in the 10th. To have the 8th house hanging out in-between these two houses is to indicate that complexity is a necessary throughway to success. There is no success worth having that hasn\u2019t prompted us to look closely at our fears, our hang ups, our vulnerabilities. So, as we rise up to the 10th house, the 8th house becomes a necessary component in the journey. Its aversion to the 1st house\/ascendant is less about lack of personal willpower or an ineffective planet and more about the things we consciously hide, what that planet is keeping. Planets in the 8th don\u2019t speak to the 1st not because they don\u2019t have anything to say, but because what is to be said is heavy, complex, hard, and most times, taboo. We don\u2019t want to say them, or acknowledge them.The 12th house is less complex in that it represents the dispersal of reality. In this house to \u201cgo there\u201d means nothing, as there does not exist. Reality tends to be the realm of existence that humans complicate. Rather, the 12th house presents as a doorway between realities, where you go to forget the self, not to examine the self. Planets in the 12th represent a liminal space between life and death, and as such, concerted human effort, in the ego sense, fails miserably in this house. That is why human action and reaction here, also in the ego sense, is often called self-sabotage. The process of surrendering belongs to this house. After all is said and done, and you\u2019ve done the best you could to erect some personal reality of yours, the time comes to let go. It will either come to pass, or disappear into the ether, an unbelonging. And really, there is nothing complicated about the act of surrender.If we rise up to the 10th house, then we rest finally in the 12th, where planets enter to recharge, to get a grip on what was accomplished, what was a failure, and where to go now. But first, a pause.  And so, the sextile between the 10th and the 12th house, rather, represents the stimulation of retrospect, of glancing upon our successes or actions from a place of distance and non-judgement. To be reborn again into the 1st house with 12th house wisdom. What\u2019s done is done. The impetus to improve or to fix the human condition belongs to the 8th house. Your only job in the 12th is to enter into spaces of compassion, quiet reflection on and acceptance of what is without trying to change what is. Planets in the 12th house operate in a blind spot to the first house, but also in square to the 3rd house. So, planets here can feel unknowable, hard to get a grip on or to understand. That is because they operate above, beside, or without the human trappings of traditional knowledge. They ripen not with sheer brain power, but a higher power.The 8th house and 12th support one another through trine. It is usually the gunk we drag up in the 8th house that can meet a compassionate ending and release in the 12th house. For example, my anxiety disorder is a result of my specific 8th house set up. And I can therapize, and study, and talk about my anxiety to death. To know it, how it operates, where it came from is all helpful. The gaze here is on my own damaged fear responses. But try as one might, to think hard about a thing isn\u2019t to solve it. And while western medicine and other such remedies exist as management, I believe that true healing lies in that 12th house trine, where we bring our human neuroses and just sit with them, accept them. That alone galvanizes so much healing. The 12th house as a place of the collective unconscious brings with it, also, the knowing that one isn\u2019t suffering alone. That is why 12th house people can get to work in philanthropic and other helpful ways, as they know the pain others go through firsthand. It as also why 12th house artists and creators are able to so succinctly evoke an emotion out of us.To use another example, the 8th house is where we go for occult practices. So, say you pull a tarot card about the outcome of job interview. In a tarot spread, the Universe speaks through symbolism, a 12th-house brand of vague language. In that instance of divinatory work, it feels you get a glimpse of something bigger, a plan, a message, the reality underneath reality. And that is the 12th house working in harmony with an active 8th house. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re hung up over needing this job, an anxious mess! You\u2019ve allowed all your 8th house hang ups and anxieties to run the show. You get your spread, you see it, you judge it as good, or bad or confusing. But the reality of the outcome is not up to you, really, even though mortal actions such as resume building and good impressions work, at the end of the day, there is a metaphysical underworking to the way things pan out for us. Entering into an energetic space of creation is what necessitates the best outcomes. And so, the trine to the 12th can also enter in as the force of Universe, either moving you in or out of situations for your highest good. And perhaps, for a time, this is unbeknownst to you.Dear reader, these are just my own musings of the 8th and 12th. I hope I was able to provide a personal brand of clarity for the two houses always shrouded in the most mystery.","title-cc":53,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":6786,"body-wc":1250,"media":0,"comments":64},"1659":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"A shaky phone picture through binoculars made the planets look like hearts!","body-text":"","title-cc":75,"title-wc":12,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":13},"1661":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Is it Correct Guys?","body-text":"","title-cc":19,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":10},"1662":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"I've had this Egyptian astrology card for probably 30 years.

This is a natural square in astrology. Squares are aggravating, frustrating, and defeating energy. Leo and Scorpio are both fixed signs, so have the same goal. But since they are different elements, (water and fire) they go about accomplishing this goal in different ways. Both generations want essentially the same thing: a healthy society that encourages happiness for all its citizens. Leo is more materialistic, which explains why Baby Boomers value big business, luxury, material comforts. Millennials might focus too much on the shadow side of Leo, which is self-aggrandisement and selfishness, seeing Baby Boomers as separate to the rest of society\/ think that they act like they\u2019re too good for humanitarianism (Aqua.) I\u2019m basing this off the 2019 UK vote, which showed Baby Boomers voting more right-wing, vs Millennials voting left-wing. So there\u2019s an obvious divideScorpio seeks a deeper understanding of things\u2014Millennials reject social conformities like monogamy, heteronormativity, ownership of property, child birth etc. They\u2019re more open to spirituality and darker matters. They reject the \u2018traditional standard\u2019 because those things don\u2019t grant emotional fulfilment.Then you have Sag Plutos, making their own journeys and exploring whatever is leftover of the Baby Boomer generation. A lot of it is in ruins: climate change, oil plants, massive debts and lack of affordable housing. They have the power to recognise and use opportunities to their benefit, and use their voices as a powerful change to the narrative.

As you can read from excerpts of the article in posted in comment below, for WWI Saturn and Pluto were conjunct in Cancer (the opposite sign of where it is now), and for WWII they were in an exact fixed-sign square (Taurus-Leo). I wanted to post this because as many of us know, Saturn and Pluto are now fairly close to each other in Capricorn (6 degrees apart), and will come into close conjunction (at around 22\/23 degrees) in January of 2020.  I have a feeling that when that happens, it may well set the tone for the whole of that year since Pluto tends to be very deeply-felt and Saturn is in its home sign- so the feeling is that something is being 'set in stone' so to speak.  And already, we're seeing a lot of global tensions in the form of:-Turkey invading Syria (and the Kurds allying with Russians)-Trump's Impeachment and Ukraine investigation-Britain having a troubled Brexit-Climate protests globally-India 'invading' Kashmir without warning, continuing to keep it on lockdown-Protests in Hong Kong and the Chinese cracking down authoritatively on it, etc.It feels like there is a lot of unrest in the air.

Because the Moon (and lunations) can represent where intentions can emotionally resonate, and Jupiter is the principle of expansion, optimism and faith, I'm using the confluence of these two planets and their locations in your chart to construct some fairly simple intentions and affirmations to consider. Capricorn and Pisces also form a harmonious sextile, and the Moon will aspect the Pluto-Saturn conjunction through this sextile, something I think matters as we consider what awaits January 12th and the themes that are probably already presenting themselves. Though not as seamless as a trine, sextiles still provide ease and success when acted upon and acknowledged. The opportunity awaits to be seized!\u00a0(I understand that some people will be getting shit faced tonight, but you can easily do these on New Year's Day too.)Aries: I intend to set time aside to visit and nurture my hidden parts. Time spent in silence and introspection benefits me as I move into 2020. In these spots between my thoughts, remarkable new ideas for my changing career and purpose will reveal themselves to me. I move into my position on the world stage with ease and grace, and with with the invisible powers of cosmic companions always guiding me. Any insecurity becomes my security, and any hardship is insurance for my benefit.Taurus: I intend to find and spend time with the people who matter most to me, whose goals and ideas are congruent with mine, and who champion my growth. I excel in communities of like-minded individuals, and flourish when I challenge my own beliefs and worldviews. 2020 brings to me a refreshed set of principles and beliefs, foreign experiences, teachings, and hope. I look forward to sharing what I've learned and experienced in the spaces that take me as I am.Gemini: I intend to plant wondrously imaginative seeds for my career and invest in opportunities and people who share my vision. As I skip into 2020, I am reassured knowing that all I need is there. Debts are paid, forgiven, and pave the way for my comeback. Financial strength is my birthright and easily achieved through the discipline I am being taught. I learn to share and trust others with my gems, immaterial or material. I move into vulnerability knowing that it is my greatest strength, and provides the biggest dividends for my dreams.Cancer: I intend to form healthy boundaries with loving people, and enter into relationships with a sobered and practical mind. What I have learned from others, good or bad, only serves to strengthen my belief in myself, and my suspicion that life is indeed good after all. As I enter 2020, my faith, though perhaps battered and bruised, remains alive. My emotional immune system is strong. I open my heart to new ideas and ways of thinking, beliefs that soothe my soul. I open my arms to people who wish to bring new ideas my way. I easily let go of people unworthy of my deep running waters, knowing that they will be replaced in multitudes by softer and kinder spirits.\u00a0Leo: I intend to form a healthy relationship to...health. I know that my body is sacred, and that the foods and tonics I supply it with serve to enhance my day to day life. I am worthy of a firm, robust body, mind, and spirit. As I enter 2020, it is knowing that the work I do on a daily basis matters, and that I have the power to change and inspire my everyday, turning what is mundane into something magical. I rely on my spirituality and the help of benefactors to change what needs changing, and to uplift what may feel deflated. I have sound financial acuity, and am rich beyond means in heart, warmth and joy. The Sun shines forth as I go forth.Virgo: I intend to dream bigger dreams of love, romance, and partnership. As I enter 2020, I know that disillusionment is turned to diamonds--clear cut and beautiful. Where I may have been left adrift by others set me on the path to wash up on shore of a love and personal life I never thought possible. I am grateful for the wild ride, and look forward to relaxation. The people and partnerships I meet, form and continue in 2020 inspire me to create, to play, to have fun, and to just enjoy. I am reacquainted with my inner child.Libra: I intend to grow wherever it is that I am planted. I know that the peace and security of home cannot be taken from me, and travels and flows wherever it is that I go. I am safe, I am stable. As I move into 2020, I know that my body is restorative and strong, that ailments act as a catapult to launch me into stronger and enduring vitality. My work in the world is shifting, but gathers purpose and meaning along the way, as long as I have faith that I am on the right path. I do not mourn anything that has been buried or come to an end, for I know that they were seeds, and the forthcoming blossom will be worth it.Scorpio: I intend to honor my words, thoughts, and ideas. Where my communication and mental processes may have been wrought with difficulty or confusion, I now let move me into creative ways to articulate and express. I am allowed to be unique, to think differently, and to let pain inform some of my greatest works.What I say and what I think matters. The players in my everyday life are of benefit to me. My neighborhood, my commute, my siblings...they all conspire to fill my brain and my life with fresh new perspectives and inspiration. I am out from under the trap of intellectual expectation, and I brand my own version of intelligence.

Take advantage of the newly launched coronavirus telemedicine services (like Roman's) if you feel you may have it.I love looking to the sky for answers, but to make good work of it, we have to keep our feet on the ground.Okay - that said...I want to share some interesting finds.Here are my two resources:Llewellyn's 2020 Astrological Daily Planetary GuideNew York Time's Official Coronavirus Timeline pageFor a few years now, I've found Llewellyn's daily guide to be a poignant resource for tracking both the major and minor movements in the planets from week-to-week.

It seems that the Aquarius archetype is at odds with the lovey dovey commercialized Valentine's Day we know of now. But maybe it makes...perfect sense?Enjoy below and enjoy tomorrow, whether you are coupled or single.~~~~~~~~Reframing Aquarius: How the cool and detached offer us our best chance at loveLike Capricorn and Christmas, Aquarius and Valentine\u2019s Day seem to be fundamentally at odds. Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more romantic days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story. \u00a0You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine\u2019s Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: love!\u00a0 But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid\u2019s foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with undiluted passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius enjoys a revolution. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a new way of thinking.Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love artful and Pisces makes love dreamy\u2014Aquarius makes love ideal. In any working definition of the word romance, \u201cidealized love\u201d makes a literal or alluded appearance. It can be said, then, that from Aquarius, the idea of love is born and celebrated. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn\u2019t altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. So in enhancing love to its most ideal place, the Aquarius romance comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a humanitarian sign, Aquarius is not particular about love\u2014 who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it\u2019ll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more romantic, more loving, than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren\u2019t sensual enough for Taurus, refined enough for Libra, or magical enough for Pisces\u2014Aquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius\u2019s love of humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are.Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as a historical template for the beginnings of Valentine\u2019s Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer\u2019s daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer\u2019s daughter, and signed it, your Valentine. Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God\u2019s love, and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the typical Valentine\u2019s Day decorations we see today. In this brief tale, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A humanitarian thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored testaments of the sign\u2014the push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless empathy for the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Religion aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love, in all its myriad forms, is for all. Anyone who dies for love is a romantic to me. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine\u2019s Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time. But let\u2019s mount more evidence...In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with Gamelion, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to Sacred Wedding and Divine Wedding. These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for the native, and most often it points to the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to these cultivations of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of fidelity. Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in love, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental structure of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent in the Aquarian archetype are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. No living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality\u2014their love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and unhealthy. The Aquarius model of live and let live in love can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us our best chance of healthy love\u2014as when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, *wink*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius offers\u2014a love given the air to float, fly, and transcend.","title-cc":74,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":7790,"body-wc":1317,"media":0,"comments":33},"1705":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"What do you think about 2025?","body-text":"The chart for 2025 looks so exciting.

This is going to be my last reddit post, so I want to leave Caps with some word of advice from my own personal experience.Capricorn Moons probably know the feeling of emotional resistance better than any other moon sign. Whether this is due to heavy Saturn and Pluto transits, or just the nature of the sign, I wanted to say this: please be easier on yourself. You overwork yourself at your business because society has told you it will give you fulfillment, you cling onto past energies because you fear the future wont be as grand.I was reflecting on these past couple years and I realized the worst times are when Im stuck in my head. Maybe its my moon in the third house, but when we trap our emotional energy, we get stuck and cant allow new energy to come in. A little story:2018 was a very fun year for me, full of friends and romance. By years end, things started to naturally fade, and I spent all of 2019 trying to recreate that life. Its funny, when I let it go in 2020, I am blessed to say 2020 had very similar energy to that of 2018, but much more mature (as I was older) and somehow much better. Alas, the end of 2020 was met with more resistance, and now I am in the process of letting go, and already feel free. This is truly the best way to live.You don't need to let go. The good times were created by you because you were there, and you created those feelings from within. Do not fear those feelings being dead in the water, you'll find happiness resurfaces in different but even better ways as you learn and grow through life. Have you felt the shift in energy?Lastly, Capricorns: Stop climbing the mountain. You don't need to always reach for something, fight something. We are the goats, yes? Goats take their time as they climb peak after peak, grazing and enjoying the atmosphere as they JUMP from place to place. Life does not have to be a challenge.Damn I was listening to \"The Fool On The Hill\" by the Beatles while this was playing that was nice lol","title-cc":22,"title-wc":3,"body-cc":2025,"body-wc":383,"media":0,"comments":103},"1729":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Sarah Paulson\u2019s 11th house and the Archetypal Mommy","body-text":"Do you guys know her?

She\u2019s hella talented. And beautiful.Anyway I was watching her latest film, Run, on Hulu yesterday and was running through her social media mentions. In the movie she plays a creepy mom with Munchhausen syndrome by proxy.  But even before this film, it has been a long standing joke that fans and stans alike will call her \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cmommy\u201d.  Internet culture is weird. She has addressed it and claimed it too.What is SO FUNNY is that her 11th house is Cancer, the archetypal mommy. And 11th house is the place of fans, followings, audience. So that her fan base calls her mom, however weird, has symbolic resonance with her chart. As per usual, we see astrology manifesting correctly in the weirdest of ways. She has Big Mommy Energy.What\u2019s more, she has Saturn in Cancer. And the mom and mom-like figures she plays are often maleficent or are in creepy\/unsavory plots. In Run (poisonous mom), Ratched (poisonous nurse), literally all of her roles in American Horror Story, and even her so-good-but-awful role in 12 Years a Slave, playing a cruel wife and mom. She even plays hated women, like Marcia Clarke  in American Crime Story: OJ and will be back jn the series playing Linda Tripp.You know the running joke on social media is also that she cries and screams a lot. And I thought\u2014that\u2019s about as Saturn in Cancer as it gets! Frigid, scared, crying women.I find it fascinating how actor\u2019s pick roles that seem to illustrate their chart.

This is a matter that has been on my mind often enough to raise a petition about it, and although I had hoped for many of these pain points to work themselves out organically, that doesn't seem to be happening.I think my biggest concerns are that 1) the moderators are putting more work into the task than is really needed, and 2) the current rules are an attempt at coercing this subreddit into something other than what it actually is: Reddit's most generalized space for astrological topics.In my opinion, the argument that there are other subreddits for off-limits topics of discussion like r\/astrologymemes or r\/AskAstrologers is missing the point. Those communities are wonderful too, but they serve to break out into more specified content, which makes sense. r\/astrology on the other hand should serve instead as the generalized \"melting pot\" for all astrological content.One might argue then that this conceptualization opens the subreddit to low-effort or low-quality content, and to that, I would like to remind you that Reddit has a voting mechanism for a reason, aiding our moderators' efforts in allowing propagation of only the most interesting and relevant content to the front page, leaving low quality posts at the bottom of the pile to be ignored.Here is what I propose as an update to r\/astrology rules -Stay on topic - All posts must be related to Astrology. Off-topic posts will be removed.No spamming your blog or website - Posts linking to blog articles must be limited to once every 3 days at most per website linked.No advertising products or services - This includes but is not limited to offering to give someone a private reading in DMs, sharing websites or videos that offer individual readings, posting your Zodiac art, or sharing the cool custom chart wall art or jewelry you \"found\".Don't be a jerk - We expect civility in this subreddit. Those who personally attack others, or make general insults toward signs or placements, will be banned without warning.I don't want this to be a prompt for one-sided or uncivil discourse. We love our moderators and appreciate the work they put into taking care of this subreddit. I think though that we can make the work much easier for them while being a lot more inviting to all astrological interests.Let me know what you think, and add to it whatever comes to mind.Update: Thinking more about it, and this could be debated, but perhaps there should remain an explicit meme restriction, as r\/astrologymemes is fairly popular anyway, and the rule would represent our subscriber base that want to keep this subreddit at least broadly educational.","title-cc":59,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":2634,"body-wc":455,"media":0,"comments":173},"1732":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Scorpio mandala poster.

Mars rules Scorpio, so this is a homecoming. Only, there are no balloons, streamers, champagne\u2014this is no celebration of life and all its revelry. Instead, there is dust, bone, tar, and muck. Mars in Scorpio thrives in these conditions, fueling its way forward by summoning up the most tangled parts of a thing, and using it to purify and refine its direction. This is a celebration of death, our ghosts, and humankind\u2019s most immediate and shared ancestor: fear. How symbolically appropriate that this ingress falls on Halloween. The intended importance of Halloween has been watered down over the years by campy spooks and jack-o\u2019-lanterns. Historically, this was a day when the veil between worlds thinned, and the boundary between life and death blurred. Across many cultures, each with their own specific permutations, this time of the year was for reverence of the dead, whether that reverence came loaded with fear or not. As such, Mars in Scorpio ushers in a six-week period where you can excavate your own graveyards and peer around your own dark corners. Mars in Scorpio wants you to trick or trick, only instead, by daring to knock on the dusted-over and imposing doors of your own life.In the simplest way, Mars in Astrology represents movement. Both the literal movement of our bodies, and the will, passion, and drive that animates our lives and fuels our direction. Mars oversees what moves us. To get anywhere in life is to activate your Mars. Scorpio is a fixed water sign. Picture a swamp\u2014wet, but also sticky, with root systems, fog, and poisonous insects laid about like boobytraps. Swamps are perilous, almost impossible to navigate except with precise skill and the willingness to do so. Scorpio is the sign attuned the most towards the psychological and emotional boobytraps weaved into the human condition, fitting itself for survival by being brutally honest, disciplined, and by surrendering to discomfort. Scorpio has a finely tuned intuition, but what is the point of having a gut if you don\u2019t listen to it? With Mars in Scorpio, we are asked to listen, to resurrect our courage by pulling from our most raw and bloodied parts. We are asked to confront and sift through all the pretense and all the bullshit, and to arrive at the unadulterated truth of a thing, no matter how grotesque. In a way, this is a thinning of our own veils\u2014an ask to put to rest all the mechanisms that keep us living on the periphery of our own lives. While the house Mars is transiting through for you will specify where this call for ruthless clarity will occur, the general call for us all is to either step fully into a thing, giving it all our resources and focus\u2014or to send it to the guillotine once and for all. It is this awareness of death, even if only symbolic, that sharpens our senses and compels us to squeeze the most meaning and honesty out of life. Mars in Scorpio knows that fear is a renewable resource, a constant companion on life\u2019s twisted turns. Do not turn away from fear. Honor it. Let it fuel you. It is time to explore your scary corridors, your primal impulses, your darkness, your dead. On the other side of that exploration there may be a trick, or there may be a treat. Do it anyway.There will be other planetary forces at work, aiding and abetting our desire to air out the skeletons in our closets. On November 10th, Mars in Scorpio will square Saturn in Aquarius, creating a backbreaking bottleneck of energy that has been happening between the fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) all year. Saturn is the stop sign of the solar system, and Mars needs green lights. Delays, reversals, brick walls\u2014do not let this deter you. Saturn grants wisdom and mastery to our moves, and like a pressure cooker, we come out on the other side more tenderized. You can let resistance harden you or you can learn to let it soften you, to become more pliable and flexible as a result. On November 17th, Mars in Scorpio will oppose Uranus in Taurus, a planet infamous for its twists and turns. Uranus plants impulse and urge into Mars, a restlessness that can support breakthroughs and innovative action. Uranus can also deliver liberation\u2014not only can you face your skeletons, you can rid yourself of them completely, freeing up some space in your world. But if you are not cautious, if you are not traversing your Scorpionic swamps with strategy and savvy, this restlessness can also initiate breakdown, or scatter your energy like fallen pieces on a chess board. We will also likely see this dance play out on the news, through political maneuverings and other attention-grabbing world events. And then on December 7th, more than a month after all this excavating commences, Mars will square Jupiter, the greater benefic, in Aquarius. This inserts confidence and moxie, the look of a self-satisfied grin before executing a long-overdue move. This may be the sugar pill after several weeks of biting on lemons and white knuckling our way through personal crises. But don\u2019t be too free wielding with this feel-good energy. Squares to Jupiter can easily make one overestimate their abilities, confidence turned cartoonish. Our frenetic friend Mercury will backbone a lot of this ride when it enters Scorpio on November 5th. This can be the fruitful union of our thinking brain with our feeling brain. We are offered the chance to act with gut, and to also think those actions through.So, as you are donning your costumes, your fake fangs and blood, your witches\u2019 hats\u2026 as you down noxious Halloween-themed drinks while trying to remember the choreography to Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller, I hope that you also remember to hold and to nurture the most frightening parts of yourself and your life, the parts with real fangs and real blood. When you dare to rip off the mask, that is when you know who you truly are and what truly matters. Fear is the voice calling out to you as you push through the swamp, saying: this way.","title-cc":49,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":6021,"body-wc":1060,"media":0,"comments":99},"1736":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Election Day 2020 Transit Charts for US Presidential and Vice Presidential Candidates","body-text":"","title-cc":85,"title-wc":12,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":129},"1737":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Observation regarding fire signs\ud83d\udd25","body-text":"I decided to share this little note I wrote on my blog a while ago because I think fire signs are a little misunderstood.Disclaimer: these are my personal thoughts and observations. I am a fire sign myself.Fire & water are right-brained elements, which means that they are both inclined to be very creative (fact often overlooked when it comes to fire signs for some reason) & that they both deal with really strong emotions.\u00a0The difference is that water feelings run deep, while fire feelings burn out quickly.People often portray fire signs as impulsive & volatile. One moment they\u2019re mad, the next they\u2019re laughing. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re unstable or inconsistent. It makes sense when you think about it. Fire, out of all elements, is the only one that can be created by hand. It\u2019s there, then it\u2019s not. It burns, but only to a point. Our emotions are the same.Fire is candid and simplistic. A feeling is just what it is: a feeling. We feel it and we let it go. We don\u2019t swim in it like water signs do. That\u2019s why we\u2019re not inclined to hold grudges like earth signs do either. And to be honest, we're oddly sensitive to other people's energies too. Why? because fire engulfs everything around it when set free. Of course, it depends on the person\u2019s other placements too, but that\u2019s fire at its purest.","title-cc":33,"title-wc":4,"body-cc":1304,"body-wc":245,"media":0,"comments":94},"1738":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"stop blaming your problems on mercury rx","body-text":"","title-cc":40,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":0,"comments":65},"1739":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Thought this was so cute about Moon Signs","body-text":"https:\/\/xs-a-t-u-r-nx.tumblr.com\/post\/618677983455182848\/the-moon-showing-loveneeding-loveEDIT: Aww thanks so much for the award \ud83d\ude0d","title-cc":41,"title-wc":8,"body-cc":130,"body-wc":23,"media":0,"comments":87},"1740":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"A Beautiful Astrological Portrait Connecting Naya Rivera and Cory Monteith","body-text":"I want to preface this by saying that this post will be centered on celebrating the life of Naya Rivera, and finding cosmic catharsis about what Astrology can show us about this moment in time for her and her soul. I will be couching everything in my Aquarius brand of impartiality, which I hope conveys a spirit of education and understanding versus usurping a tragic moment for clout. Though, if you see it that way, I do understand. I figured that since now all the what if's and when's and how's of the event have been answered, it would be an ok time to approach this event from a spiritual POV, and add to the zeitgeist of the moment.I won't be examining the death of Naya or the circumstances surrounding it. I instead was curious about the Astrological through-line between Cory and Naya, and how the day of her recovery marked 7 years since his passing.One of their Glee costars stated that Cory, in spirit, helped find Naya yesterday, bringing closure and peace. That made me go \"hmm\". And instead of excavating the crude facts of the moment, I was curious to examine what Astrology had to say about more intangible things like spirit guides, or help from beyond, the soul, and other karmic resonances.Naya's body was recovered at 9:10 am in Ventura, CA (Lake Piru) on July 13th, 2020. sourceFor this, I want to focus on the NN (soul stuff), the MC (the most elevated part of the chart) and the Sun. Why? I figured that a recovery mission, something brought to light, would engage the planet of spotlight (Sun) and the highest moment in the sky (midheaven\/MC). NN would point more towards the soul direction of a moment. I will also incorporate the 12th house--where things hide, and especially in water. Here is what I found:-The chart of the moment of recovery for Naya has the MC at 27 degrees of Taurus. Cory's Sun in Taurus conjuncts that point.-Cory's Sun in Taurus is also in Naya's natal 12th house. When you read this from a synastry POV, there are overwhelming themes of unconscious\/subconscious bonds. Trouble, endings, loss. The Sun person illuminates the 12th house. Extrapolate if you will, to see Cory's Sun as helper\/finder of Naya's resting place, where she lost her life, where she transitioned into the unconscious-The asteroid \"Cora\", closest to Cory (which I've learned is okay--to find the object with the name CLOSEST to the one you're looking for), is exactly conjunct the NN of the moment, 28 Gemini. Naya's natal Moon is also 28 Gemini in the 1st house. Cora, besides being facsimile for \"Cory\", is a name derived from the Greek goddess Persephone. She was goddess of the underworld, and represents the \"perennial change from life to death\"-With the NN of the moment at 28 Gemini, exactly conjunct her natal Moon--we can see that the direction of karma in the moment related to her identity as mother. She put the responsibility of being a mother ahead of herself (Moon in 1st house). Reports are now showing that Naya used the last of her energy to boost her son up on the boat, unable to muster the energy to save herself.-In the chart of Naya's recovery, the asteroid \"Nayam\" was in the 12th house, and \"Nayan\" in the 7th conjunct Neptune, a planet responsible for drownings.","title-cc":74,"title-wc":10,"body-cc":3214,"body-wc":578,"media":0,"comments":31},"1741":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"The 12th House. Thoughts?","body-text":"The 12th House: House of Hidden EnemiesLike the 7th house, the 12th house can show the types of enemies we encounter based on a lack of self awareness. The 7th house shows open enemies projected from our identity (1st house). The 7th house is felt interpersonally, whereas the 12th house is felt collectively. The 12th house shows hidden enemies reflected from parts of ourselves that we have abandoned and forgotten. The sign and planets that land in the 12th house can show parts of ourselves that have been deprived, damaged, and abandoned in childhood. It shows where we weren\u2019t given proper attention and acknowledgment. Because of this, we abandon ourselves, making these traits overshadowed by the collective. The expression of signs and planets in the 12th House can be weakened due to this. When we don\u2019t give ourselves the proper attention and solitude our 12th house needs, we can almost feel enveloped and lost in other people\u2019s energy. Tapping into our 12th house requires complete solitude and connection to the divine source, without external validation \u2013 this is the only way we can truly see ourselves.Aries\/Mars in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to assert yourself, express anger and maintain your independence. You feel overshadowed by other people\u2019s anger, making it difficult to understand your own anger and instinct.Taurus\/Libra\/Venus in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your worth, your appearance, and your ability to be seen as an equal within partnerships. You feel overshadowed by other people\u2019s demands, possessions and physical appearances, making it difficult to understand your own self-worth and standing within a relationship.Gemini\/Virgo\/Mercury in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your intellect, ability to communicate and freely express yourself. You feel overshadowed by other people talking over you or criticizing you, making it difficult to clearly articulate and express yourself.Cancer\/Moon in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your sense of safety, comfort, and emotional expression. You feel overshadowed by other people\u2019s emotions and neediness, making it difficult to clearly understand your emotions and how you really feel about things.Leo\/Sun in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to shine and be seen. You feel overshadowed by other people\u2019s ego expression and need for attention, making it difficult to acknowledge yourself and let yourself be seen by others.Scorpio\/Pluto in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to transform and face darkness. You feel overshadowed by the bad in other people and their darkness\/shadow energy, making you fearful in facing your own darkness and transforming from it.Sagittarius\/Jupiter in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your beliefs, knowledge and ability to be free. You feel overshadowed by other people\u2019s freedom and ability to encounter luck, making it difficult for you to find courage in yourself to take leaps of faith at the right moments.Capricorn\/Saturn in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to have authority, create structure and leadership qualities.

He will likely die in prison, as his lawyers said even 5 years would be a life sentence.His birthday is March 19th. So I saw it fitting to cast his solar return chart. There, he is in for a Gem Rising year with transit Uranus and Venus in his 12th. He is being imprisoned for his acts of sexual violence towards women (Venus). Uranus there, to me, completes a sad story shown in his natal chart. He has natal Uranus in Cancer opposite his Capricorn Moon. His relationship to his mom and childhood was most likely cold, hardened, and erratic in some way, and that first relationship to a woman, for men, can indeed portend how one may treat women as an adult. Uranus in his Solar Return 12th, almost at the exact same degree, illustrates a disturbing culmination to that natal promise. And indeed, with all the planets that have and are transiting Capricorn right now, those issues are at the very least karmically highlighted for him if not literally. He has Capricorn moon in the 3rd, which relates to upbringing.His solar return Chiron is placed in the 11th (honors, fame) conjunct his Sun in the 10th. Soiled reputation. Chiron in Aries is also ruled by Mars, and his is natally precariously placed in square to Pluto.His natal 7th house (Taurus) becomes his SR 12th house (imprisonment revolving around personal relationships), and for what it\u2019s even worth, his SR 5th house, Libra (sexual desires), is his natal 12th. Venus rules both Libra and Taurus. So generally just a lot of themes of sexual impropriety, women, relationships, prisons, endings, death, etc.His natal 8th, the place of death and mortality, is his solar return 1st house. Maybe he will literally die. Who knows. But he is certainly in the last chapters of his life. His solar return 8th house is Capricorn, with all 3 malefics currently placed there plus Jupiter. Heavy 8th and 12th emphasis is going to make for a dark year.His solar return Venus (and thus transit Venus) is forming a trine with Saturn and Pluto. Retribution and punishment for crimes against women.His solar return Moon is in Aquarius in the 9th. Aquarius occupies the 4th house of his natal, opposite that ruthless Pluto conjunct MC in Leo. He will probably be coming to terms with his career, his role in his own demise, and likely through 9th house themes of faith and religion. It\u2019s not uncommon that convicted criminals come to devote their lives to Jesus (or whatever and whomever) while incarcerated. A real test of faith is beginning.Transit wise, Mercury direct in his natal 5th. Whatever legal deliberations were needed were carried through with the directness of a Mercury direct station. Inward analysis became outwardly expressed conclusions. Pisces occupies his natal 5th so: sex crimes and the general dark side Piscean gaslighting, seeing how far one can take things, zero boundaries, etc.There\u2019s something about his NN at 0 Pisces (conj Venus) and his Sun at 29 Pisces that is profound to me. I can\u2019t articulate it but his soul incarnated for some challenged lessons around women, sex and pleasures.

A total lunar eclipse, this event gives you one final avenue to emotionally absorb and understand the lessons Leo has taught you. Standing boldly across the sky from the Sun at 0 degrees of Leo, this lunation roars, bursting forth with undiluted passion. It is said sometimes that any planet at 0 degrees is entering new territory. Though this is the last of eclipses in Leo for some time, its finality begets urgency\u2014how will you incorporate the lion\u2019s lessons as you embark out into your new territories, the areas of your life that were set ablaze with realizations, dramas, or successes? Leo loves a show, always encouraging you to shine, take up space, and be unabashedly yourself. May what you have learned glitter through your awareness, and outward into your experience. And may you pass this final exam with flying colors, a spectacle befitting only the lion.But of course there is no getting around Leo\u2019s cooler and cerebral sister: Aquarius. All things exist on a continuum. There is no self-love without also considering the objective love of all humankind. There can be no ego without the collective that threatens to extinguish it, no heart without the veins supplying blood to it. And so as the Sun enters Aquarius on this day, focus shifts away from self and onto society. The Leo-Aquarius axis, to me, has always asked: where can your unique gifts and talents be of help and service to the world at large? Now is the time to consider this and set our compasses towards using our gifts to be a gift upon the world. And on a personal level\u2014where can the places you shine help illuminate your world at large, the grand expanse of your own life?  This is an axis of creativity\u2014whatever is built in one area serves to grow and enlighten its opposite area. The Sun in Aquarius offers us an objective look at what these eclipses have meant for the unfolding of our lives, and now with this final lunar event in Leo, grow into an emotional understanding about how to move forward with it.Uranus plays an important role in this eclipse, forming the apex of a T-Square involving the Sun and the Moon. Out of retrograde, Uranus may bring forth suddenness and surprises. A massive surge of energy in stable Capricorn, paired with your own skilled understanding of what the Leo-Aquarius eclipses have meant for you ensures that this doesn\u2019t have to be destabilizing, but invigorating, perhaps electrifying your way forward with renewed gusto. And should anything disrupt your momentum, have trust in its ability to reroute you into diviner directions. These are fated times, my friends. Eclipse seasons always are. And with Uranus in the picture, life may orchestrate plot twists you never saw coming. But if you have faith in the overall arc of your life, the story it can tell, and your own agency over those stories, you are able to turn your pages without fear of what the future holds. For you know that there are no happily ever after\u2019s without tending to what must come before.Aries & Libra: The Leo-Aquarius eclipses lit up your 5th and 11th houses. Eclipses here may have invigorated your pleasures and creativity, expanding where you already have them, or opening the door where they have been denied. The common thread of creation and joy is self-love, seeing your talents as worthy of expressing, and seeing yourself as worthy to be admired by others. There may have been invitations to not to take life so seriously, or perhaps life became so serious that your only out was unadulterated fun and flow. There is courageousness on this axis, as inevitably, what is created in the 5th receives attention in the 11th. The interplay between your friends and groups, and your own sense of authentic autonomy may have been at play, teasing out those people and places that may not fully support your creative or carnal honesty or perhaps finding the ones that do. Issues of romance and dating could have also weighed heavily, as love, and finding it, is inherently a creative act. You may have sought the solace of children, created one of your own, or else unleashed the one within. This last eclipse asks you to make concrete where you create your belonging.Leo on the cusp of the 5th house is the gift of play, Aquarius on the 11th means making sure that what you create can serve the greater whole.Leo on the cusp of the 11th house is the gift of congeniality, Aquarius on the 5th means making sure your social connections feed your heart.Taurus & Scorpio: The Leo-Aquarius eclipses illuminated the 4th and 10th houses of your chart. This axis is one of private versus public. The way you perform in your career seriously hinges upon the roots you plant for yourself. You cannot stand tall on rocky foundations. Eclipses here may have forced changes around your home or family, and seeing those changes directly benefit or subvert you in your public and vocational life. There may have also been a focus on yin and yang, passive and assertive, as teetering too far in either temperament jeopardizes your need to feel productive but to also feel at peace. Remember, you can have both. There may have even been power struggles with bosses, authority figures, family, or with your own pride surrounding house, home, and status. Keeping up with the Joneses squelches the creative energy that can be spent on building an authentic career that can serve your family and the world at large. This last eclipse asks you to make concrete your commitment to work-life balance, seeing worldly ambitions and domestic duties as equally important.Leo on the 4th house cusp is the gift of tribe and tradition, Aquarius on the 10th means letting that support your destiny.Leo on the 10th house cusp is the gift of fame, Aquarius on the 4th means always staying true to your roots.Gemini & Sagittarius: The Leo-Aquarius eclipses have rocked your 3rd and 9th houses. This is an axis of learning and teaching, community and foreign lands, communication and beliefs. This section of your chart has to do with broadening your mind and illuminating your life\u2019s path through the synthesizing of education, whether through traditional or non-traditional means. Whether in the classroom or out in your community or world at large. This new information may have tweaked or made solid your beliefs, or otherwise created wholly different ones. This last eclipse asks you to make concrete what you have learned and use it to bolster your star power as a teacher, communicating joyfully from a place of authority and wisdom.","title-cc":84,"title-wc":16,"body-cc":6643,"body-wc":1164,"media":0,"comments":47},"1750":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"DEAR PEOPLE THAT DONT BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY:","body-text":"LEAVE THE SUBREDDITBE A DECENT HUMAN BEINGLET PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS","title-cc":43,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":65,"body-wc":10,"media":0,"comments":70},"1751":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Does anyone else feel ugly\/insecure during Venus retrograde?","body-text":"My hair is all dry and frizzy, my skin isn\u2019t looking it\u2019s best and I usually have nice glowy, clear, and moisturized skin.

With the sun and the moon both in Taurus, you are being asked to take a step back and look at where you are currently in life. How do you feel when you are able to be the truest version of yourself? How does your value shine through your actions? If you have been stuck in a world that doesn\u2019t align with you, it can be painful to get through tasks or start your day. Your value does not depend on your job, your income, your social media following, or what you look like. Your value comes from what you think about yourself and how you feel on the inside. Taurus like to be grounded, so take this time to think about what it is you truly want \u2013 not how you will be looked at from society \u2013 but how you will feel doing what brings you joy. As much as others try to give us their best advice, they are often projecting their own insecurities into the situation and do not know how we are truly feeling inside either. Themes of consistency will be triggered under this New Moon, as you may be asking why you haven\u2019t reached the goals that you set for yourself. To have consistency you have to push through the times that you don\u2019t want to do whatever goal you have set for yourself, and just be present in the current moment.

And in many ways resembles an old soul, or in a metaphoric way; an old person. It's the sign of self undoing and is the closest to death. This can bring a feeling of complete peace, or in the lower form, terror paranoia delirium self pity and anguish. It's also the sign of two fishes, and can be as dark as its sister water sign Scorpio or soft as a Cancer.  It's ruled by Jupiter, the great benefactor.I emphasize that Pisces is similar to an old soul because it is essential in understanding this mysterious sign. Pisces is selfless and has little worldly ambition. Think of an old man who has done it all, it feels like it's mission on this world is done and is now ready to leave and transcend. Usually they turn to spirituality and religion. Almost turn monk like, quiet and peaceful, going with the flow of life, seeing the profound beauty in everything, letting go of desires and materialism, and being a martyr when necessary. This is Pisces at its best. With its intuition and depth of feeling, they have the capacity for great soul growth. Regular meditation and dedication to service is vital for its growth. However as it's lower self, a Pisces feels lost and turns to become indulgent and escapist. They can get too stuck in dreams which can be good but sometimes can turn into illogical thoughts, meditation can help them stay grounded. They have to realise that life itself is but a beautiful dream and they have to stay lucid. With its wisdom it can bring great insight to its loved ones and can be a healing stabilizing presence.This applies to Pisces placements in general.

(With hopefully helpful illustration.)Lots of people are talking about how bad this Mercury retrograde is. But, it's usually far more than can be attributed to Mercury.The chart above is of the transiting planets right now.  Imagine the chart is transparent, and lay it on top of your own natal chart, matching up the signs.Aquarius is packed - mercury rx is only a small part of the picture. The arrows show which signs (in your natal chart) would be receiving stressful aspects from all this stuff in aquarius now.  Any natal planets in your chart, in taurus and scorpio are getting squared by the transiting aquarius planets (see the red lines\/arrows on the chart).  If you have planets in both taurus and scorpio, you may be receiving T-Squares (squares to both signs at once).Anyone with natal planets in Leo is receiving a lot of oppositions from aquarius right now.Note that there's an extra effect, because of transiting uranus and mars in taurus. Again, anyone with natal planets in taurus, scorpio, aquarius or leo can receive stressful, disruptive effects. Not a guarantee - lots of things to consider, such as which natal planets, what their condition is natally, and what else is happening for you at the same time.Be sure to look at the degree numbers. Not all these transiting planets will be hitting your natals at exactly the same time.  See how juptiter is at 12 degrees today? Look for things in your natal chart at 12 degrees of ANY sign. The signs shown in red on the graphic are the more difficult ones. The other signs receive insignificant or flowing aspects, like sextile and trine.Note that transiting Mars is at 18 degrees. So, look for anything near 18 in your chart, etc. Always match up the degrees, allowing at least a degree orb for the faster planets, and a couple of degrees or slower ones like saturn and uranus.Also notice which of your houses these transiting planets are in.  Where is aquarius in your chart? Which house. I recommend you make your chart in whole sign houses, for ease of understanding. (Both astro.com and astro-seek.com let you choose which house system you want to use.) Transiting saturn will be there for a bit over 2 years, jupiter for a year. Sun, mercury and venus only stick around for a matter of weeks. (Note that the transiting moon has been in aquarius as well, but now is in pisces - it only stays in a sign for a couple of days. Of course, this means it's heading toward teaming up with transiting uranus and mars in taurus soon.)Look at where Taurus is in your natal chart. Which house? Transiting mars and uranus are there, stirring things up in that area of life for you.  Keep in mind it likely isn't a constant thing. Mars will be in that house of yours from early january this year to early march. But Uranus will be in that house for about 7 years.","title-cc":74,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":2854,"body-wc":515,"media":0,"comments":62},"1790":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Be careful when people offer to do readings on here and other astrology subreddits.","body-text":"I see people offering to read charts for free and that's great!

I know what that's like, because I have a history of depression and burnout that goes back to high school (decades).But I've also made major changes in my life during major Saturn transits -- because I believed in myself, made big decisions, and accepted help from friends and family to do it.I'm going through a Saturn transit conjunct my natal Moon right now and I feel great. I feel like encouraging other people to have hope and know these 'down' times are only temporary.The secret is these kinds of Saturn transits bring up unworthiness. So we feel down or depressed or stagnant to the extent that we feel unworthy of happiness or well being. The other part of the secret is that because of Saturn's social interface through paternalistic familial influence (father, teacher figures) we begin putting on ourselves expectations pre-fabricated by these people and society without our input. We start expecting things of ourselves they do -- even without cause or leeway given to our uniqueness.You don't have to.You can literally just stop believing in all the stuff you've heard people say about success and failure, stop saying it to yourself. Stop believing in failure (or success).Instead -- be true to yourself today by re-committing yourself to understanding yourself best you can, trusting yourself to make the next move, trusting yourself to follow your own ideals.Stop taking off-the-rack beliefs about success or failure. Stop believing because you haven't made it by 30 (or any other age) that you're failing. No, you're on a journey and you're on a path that is your own. Your parents, grandparents, and teachers haven't been in your shoes or down this path -- and they never will. If you don't trust yourself to make the right moves and decisions for you there is always the chance you'll feel like a failure or feel unworthy.Saturn's influence is a bit like lead, slower and heavier, but we all have times where things slow down a bit or feel heavier. Don't let it steal your emotional balance or perspective on yourself and life.What matters most is what you've pieced together by the end of your life. Something you can look back on and be proud of -- not because its big or glows like the legends of worldly success put forth by the generators of motivational sayings and glossy magazines. Because it resonates with the real you inside and is true to your integrity.","title-cc":63,"title-wc":12,"body-cc":2499,"body-wc":435,"media":0,"comments":41},"1794":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"I drew an illustration based on my birth chart","body-text":"","title-cc":46,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":31},"1795":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's second child has been born - what do you think about her chart?","body-text":"","title-cc":96,"title-wc":17,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":111},"1796":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Normal to feel like you\u2019re reliving the past during these retrogrades\/eclipse season?","body-text":"I feel like I\u2019m the person I was a year ago right now, but not in a good way.

This is taken from the most intuitive side of psychology, namely gestalt psychology, which in my opinion is what comes closest in terms of pure reasoning to the logic of astrology and the occult sciences in general.Here you can see three different pictures, but each one of them has different interpretations according to what you interpret as the figure and what you interpret as the background.The correct use of astrology, in my opinion, should not be to point at a chart and say \"oh, this is why x is happening, it's because this chart shows this aspect\/transit. The transit\/aspect is causing what is happening to me right now\". It actually be the opposite. You should look at your self, at your inner life, at your first-hand experience (and this is why I think that studying astrology without studying the psyche is almost useless), and use astrology as a tool to discern, in your field of consciousness, what is the figure and what is the background. So instead of saying \"x planet is giving me a very hard time\" or \"brace yourself, x transit is going to happen\" you might say \"oh, I'm having a major Pluto transit, this is why I'm having such a hard time. I better find those areas of my life and of my self that need urgent transformation, or I'm going to be in trouble\". Or, to make another example: \"Oh, I thought everybody was just being annoying, but it turns out that mars is transiting my natal moon\".This way, you use astrology to properly discern what is the background from what is the figure, bringing clarity, power and purpose into your daily existence.To put it in other words once again: your first-hand, personal experience and the content of a given chart are not separate entities and do not represent separate realities. They complement each other; one brings more clarity to the other and vice versa.","title-cc":29,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":2330,"body-wc":411,"media":0,"comments":34},"1798":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"Transition of last night\u2019s Blood Moon in Leo","body-text":"","title-cc":44,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":9},"1799":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"I would like to recommend another book.

Sun here is promising for her. But--she's a politician already, so regardless of a win or loss, she'll remain a bright spot in politics for the year to come.Kamala's SR Sun is square Saturn and Pluto in Capricorn in her SR 2nd. Pluto and Saturn are both lifeforce suckers. In an innocuous way, we can say her 11th house activities are burdened by responsibility, restriction, challenge as far as resources and finances. The square between the 2nd house and 11th house describes the tension between what is yours, what substantiates you--and freely giving of yourself to others. The price of a dream. Frankly, wondering if this points towards all the money Harris has spent campaigning, and her personal efforts to recoup in the next year. As an indication of a win, it is iffy. Though, it doesn't harm her astrological chances, to me. The presence of Jupiter with Pluto and Saturn in her SR 2nd does suggest windfalls, financial success or ease--only to have to put it towards some Saturninan use. For example, Saturn spends money on paying off debt. Not glamourous, but necessary.Kamala's SR Moon and ASC are in Sagittarius. This moves her natal 7th house to her SR 1st house. So one on one affairs with others are of import for her this year. Such is the work of a public figure. Oh, so many hands to shake and meetings to take! The SR Moon shows your emotional efforts and where they will be placed over the next year. Moon up front and center in her 1st house makes for an emotive year, on where she is sensitive to her environments. In Sag, those environments could very well be vast, large, and amorphous, tending to many groups of people at once. This is par for the course of any politician, but does it mean a win? Maybe. The ruler of her SR Sag is Jupiter. And her SR Jupiter is trine her SR MC and SR Venus.Having SR Venus conjunct the midheaven is wonderful for a public career, one in which you are well-liked and received by others. Moon in the 1st does that too. Though, Venus is fallen in Virgo. So if you take detriment seriously, there is something harmed by Harris's SR Venus operating within this sign.  A rote operator, a nitpicking Nancy. Though, Venus here lends a critical and helping eye, and conjunct her Virgo MC, I'd say its promising that Harris will be getting to work, and with relative ease and praise, fixing and ordering things. Again--she could do this as VP or as a regular politician or as a private citizen. Though, Venus on the MC during the year you embark on a career change is wonderfully promising. And being embolded via trine by Jupiter in establishment Capricorn helps. Her SR Sun in the 11th is ruled by this Venus as well.Harris has natal Virgo in the 4th, so bringing the 4th to the 10th certainly makes for a year out in the open! This would be antithetical to what we saw in Hillary Clinton, where after unfairly loosing, she retreated to the woods.  Harris also has natal Venus in Virgo, making her Venus Return cemented for the upcoming year.It also helps that her SR Venus in Virgo conj. MC is getting a trine from Saturn. Helpful Saturn aspects being structure and ease of accountability and structure. We can say Venus and Saturn are both society planets in a way, with Venus how we interface one on one and Saturn placing those interactions in containers that shape society, or move it. SR Saturn trine Venus also says something scrupulous and honest about her career endeavors for this upcoming year, a practical and cautious person.Unfortunately, Harris SR Mercury is RX and in Scorpio in the 12th. The ruler of the MC for the upcoming year in 12th house subterfuge. On the bright side, Harris has natal Mercury in Scorpio going for her. So she'd be used to the temperament here. But on the not so great side, RX Mercury in the SR 12th and opposite SR Uranus reminds me of getting shocking or sudden bad news.  Information somehow held against someone. It may just color the character of the election itself--with so much mail-in voting happening, we won't really know the result of the election on election night, and rather, a couple of weeks or EVEN MONTHS after. Mercury RX during mail-in ballot season is awful as far as losing things, organizing things, counting things, etc. It's going to be a shit show. But because this Mercury rules of Harris's SR MC and Venus--it may be that this confusion ultimately works out for her win. Harris's natal Scorpio is in the 6th house of government and bureaucracy, of the mundane things we do to establish order. That moving to the 12th speaks to the chaos that can ensue.Joe Biden will have a birthday on 11\/20, after the election. Without getting too far into it, his SR Sun is in his 1st, and rules his SR MC in Leo. His SR Mercury is also right on his SR ASC of Scorpio, and his SR Moon in Capricorn is involved in a tight conjunction with SR Pluto, Saturn and Jupiter in the 3rd. There is something serious and sober about that. Plus SR Mercury on the ASC shows a busy bee for the year.","title-cc":104,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":5504,"body-wc":1010,"media":0,"comments":73},"1819":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Interesting thing I looked up today.

His natal Pisces Moon (and therefore transit Neptune) also squares his bombastic and frankly narcissistic Sun conj. Jupiter in Gemini, further exacerbating these delusions of grandeur. Neptune square natal Jupiter is perfect for finding religion, and unfortunately can result in a lot of fanaticalism. Most Christian televangelists have very very strong Jupiter or Pisces. With the natal Sun there, his ego is more than tied up in this new, ramped up holier than thou disposition. Adding fuel to the fire.Now his natal Neptune is in Sag. Guess where Jupiter is now folx? Yep, Sag\u2014in Western Astrology. That means there is a double Jupiter to Neptune circus playing out for him, and BOTH worsened by the triple passes of retrogradation. Transit Jupiter is pretty much done with him, but laid the groundwork for his...I want to say, extended manic episode. Jupiter blows everything up.What does this create? A t-square! Neptune opposite Sun\/Jupiter. And a Pisces Moon apex. The release from the tension is found through his Pisces Moon, which is why religion is of particular importance for him right now. (Plus I didn\u2019t mention that natal Neptune opposite natal Sun and Jupiter can create this fantasy wherein you believe you are the best, that no one understands you or is on your level, and frankly someone with disassocative personality and mood disorders. The ego is fractured by the dissolution of Neptune). A mutable T Square can also make ripe conditions for someone who is erratic. Also fitting for his bipolar disorder.I also found it interest to note that Kanye\u2019s mom died the last time Jupiter was in Sag. Many think his latent mental illnesses were worsened by her death and ultimately laid the groundwork for the woefully flawed personality we see before us now. A Jupiter cycle indeed.Runner up\u2014Uranus in Taurus is also conjunct his Venus and Mars conjunction. Shake ups and eccentricity and sporadic direction galore. Specifically regarding the women in his life (forbidding make up for North, forbidding sexiness for  Kim).Kanye\u2019s rising of Cancer is not rock solid. But if it were true, the moon in Pisces would be playing out in the 9th house of religion and spirituality (along with transit Neptune there now), and the Sun conj Jupiter in Gemini would be playing out in the 12th house of psychic trauma, undoing and mental illness. Plus transit Saturn and Pluto would be in his 7th, explaining his tightened reigns around the relationships in his life.

Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more romantic days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story~~.~~  You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine\u2019s Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: love! But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid\u2019s foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with undiluted passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius enjoys a revolution. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a new way of thinking.Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love artful and Pisces makes love dreamy\u2014Aquarius makes love ideal. In any working definition of the word romance, \u201cidealized love\u201d makes a literal or alluded appearance. It can be said, then, that from Aquarius, the idea of love is born and celebrated. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn\u2019t altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. So in enhancing love to its most ideal place, the Aquarius romance comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a humanitarian sign, Aquarius is not particular about love\u2014 who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it\u2019ll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more romantic, more loving, than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren\u2019t sensual enough for Taurus, refined enough for Libra, or magical enough for Pisces\u2014Aquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius\u2019s love of humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are.Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as a historical template for the beginnings of Valentine\u2019s Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer\u2019s daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer\u2019s daughter, and signed it, your Valentine. Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God\u2019s love, and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the typical Valentine\u2019s Day decorations we see today. In this brief tale, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A humanitarian thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored testaments of the sign\u2014the push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless empathy for the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Religion aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love, in all its myriad forms, is for all. Anyone who dies for love is a romantic to me. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine\u2019s Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time. But let\u2019s mount more evidence...In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with Gamelion, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to Sacred Wedding and Divine Wedding. These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for the native, and most often it points to the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to these cultivations of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of fidelity. Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in love, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental structure of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent in the Aquarian archetype are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. No living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality\u2014their love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and unhealthy. The Aquarius model of live and let live in love can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us our best chance of healthy love\u2014as when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, *wink*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius offers\u2014a love given the air to float, fly, and transcend.In a sense, and as alluded to above, Aquarius love can be cerebral. But as all things start with thought, this isn\u2019t to be feared. The belief of a thing creates the experience of a thing. So for Aquarius to hold you in their minds with love and affection is to tap into a potent creative energy, one that serves as the basis for all emotion and action. Intellect has no bounds. Neither do the Aquarius flights of fancy. And because these ideas are fixed, good luck changing the Aquarian mind. Once loved, always loved. For Aquarius, the idea of love for a person, up close or from afar, is to render that love timeless and shapeless, graduated out the physical dimensions of gift-giving, face-time and attention, and into an ethereal experience. Aquarius is the sign of freedom and independence. To give love the freedom to expand, to individuate, untethered by expectation or precedent, is to experience ecstasy.Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. There is, then, a resonance with Aquarius and Saturn\u2019s sign of exaltation\u2014Libra. Libra, in some ways, is the sign of marriage, one-on-one partnership, diplomacy, and fairness. Therefore, there is a through-line connecting the idea of peaceful partnership and love to the Aquarius archetype. With this link, Saturn, and by virtue, Aquarius, can delight when relationships become stable and enduring, planting fertile ground for love and romance to blossom perennially.In sum, I invite you to reframe what you\u2019ve heard about Aquarius. Leave room for the wondrous ways in which this sign offers us our best chance at experiencing a true love, and hold space for a history that can corroborate it. Remember that as the water bearer, Aquarius has within it all the emotional capacity apparent in any other sign. Only, unlike any other sign, Aquarius shoulders these emotional conditions with impenetrable strength and understanding, turning them into nutrient, tilling human soil, watering it with compassion. In this alchemical process, all human experience, the sordid and splendid, meet their highest resolution in the arms of Aquarius. It is this level of belonging, of feeling seen and heard, that allows unbridled love to flow. It could be that the Aquarius tendency for distance and austerity is merely erected as a means of protection. That the love they feel for others must somehow be contained behind a wall, less it completely overwhelm them, less their waters drown the world. But do not be mistaken\u2014beyond the ideas of coldness and detachment lies a soft, loving center. A sweetness disguised, but always alive.\u201cLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mindAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\u201d","title-cc":76,"title-wc":12,"body-cc":10212,"body-wc":1726,"media":0,"comments":47},"1834":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Saturn is the lord of the rings","body-text":"","title-cc":31,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":21},"1835":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Here's the planetary overview for October, enjoy!","body-text":"","title-cc":49,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":37},"1836":{"time":"2021-11-04","title":"Placidus vs. Whole vs. Equal houses: An animated comparison","body-text":"","title-cc":59,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":43},"1837":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"What was your \"Oh Shit Astrology Is Real\" moment?","body-text":"could be a transit or something about your natal chart that really resonated with you","title-cc":49,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":85,"body-wc":15,"media":0,"comments":222},"1838":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"I decided to change career and to be a professional astrologer!","body-text":"hello everyone!

Happy Valentine's Day.I want to disclaim, before you jump in, that Love in this write-up and in my opinion, is not a feat of romantic heroism or distilled in ambiguous twin-flame theory. It is not a Drew Barrymore rom-com or an episode of The Bachelor. The Love I speak of here transcends the human trappings of performance, expectation, and desperation. The Love I speak of here, the Aquarius Love, is dispassionate, impersonal, and vastly encompassing. It is a validation of humanity, in all its forms. It is the simple act of non-judgement and fundamental acceptance, that allows the human spirit space to breathe and be. That is my Love.I want to disclaim, also, that this write-up is about the archetype of Aquarius, what exists in the ether independent of human form. I write from my personal brand of Mercury conjunct Neptune magic. Therefore, this is not necessarily about your Aquarius Sun mother, or your Aquarius Venus crush, or about historical figures of Aquarian nature and lore. It is about energy. What human beings do with that energy sprouts a myriad of potential. Below is one of those potentials.Like Capricorn and Christmas, Aquarius and Valentine\u2019s Day seem to be fundamentally at odds. Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more romantic days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story. \u00a0You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine\u2019s Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: love!\u00a0 But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid\u2019s foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with an alien passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius can enjoy a revolution, a subversion, a brain-fuck. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a different way of thinking. If you choose to want to think it, that is\u2014Aquarius doesn\u2019t care!Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love delightful and Pisces makes love dreamy or transcendent\u2014Aquarius makes love ideal. In any working definition of the word romance, \u201cidealized love\u201d makes a literal or alluded appearance. It could be said, then, that from Aquarius, the idea of love is born, even if not practiced. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn\u2019t altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. In potentializing love to an ideal place, the Aquarius Love comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a human sign, Aquarius is not particular about love\u2014 who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it\u2019ll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius Love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more loving than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren\u2019t sensual or material or comfortable enough for Taurus, where things aren\u2019t refined or classic enough for Libra, or magical and hypnotizing enough for Pisces\u2014Aquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius\u2019s diligent eye on humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are.Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as an historical template for the inception of Valentine\u2019s Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer\u2019s daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer\u2019s daughter, and signed it, your Valentine. Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God\u2019s love (an impersonal Aquarius resonance, equality under an all-seeing eye), and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the Valentine\u2019s Day decorations we see today. In this brief recounting, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A human thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored tenets of the sign\u2014the push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless openness to the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Questionable religious ideology aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love,  in all its myriad of incarnated forms, in all of its ceremonials, is for all. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine\u2019s Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time.In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with Gamelion, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to Sacred Wedding and Divine Wedding. These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for an individual, and can points towards the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to this cultivation of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of fidelity. Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in intimate partnership, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental nature of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent to  Aquarius symbolism are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. Let me poetically pontificate: no living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality\u2014their Love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius Love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and maladaptive. The Aquarius model of live and let live in relationship can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us a great chance at healthy love\u2014as when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, *wink*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius can offer\u2014a Love given the air to float, fly, and flex.In a sense, and as alluded to above, Aquarius love can be cerebral. But all things start first with thought. The belief of a thing creates the experience of a thing. So for Aquarius to hold you in their minds with love and  affection is to tap into a potent creative energy, one that serves as the basis for all emotion and action. And because these ideas are fixed, good luck changing the Aquarian mind. Once loved, always loved. For Aquarius, the idea of love for a person, up close or from afar, is to render that love timeless and shapeless, graduated out the physical dimensions of gift-giving, face-time and attention, and into an ethereal experience. Aquarius is associated with personal freedom and independence. Aquarius gives Love the freedom to expand, to individuate, untethered by expectation or precedent.Aquarius is traditionally ruled by Saturn. There is, then, a resonance with Aquarius and Saturn\u2019s sign of exaltation\u2014Libra. They trine one another, and share a common Saturnian DNA. Libra, in some ways, is the sign of marriage, one-on-one partnership, diplomacy, and fairness. Therefore, there is an invisible but what I find a personally noteworthy through-line and resonance connecting the idea of peaceful partnership to the Aquarius archetype. With this link, Saturn, and by virtue, Aquarius, can delight when relationships become stable and enduring, planting fertile ground for love to blossom perennially, even after the cold and dry winters.In sum, I invite you to reconsider what you\u2019ve heard about Aquarius. Leave room for the wondrous ways in which this sign offers us love, and hold space for a history that can corroborate it symbolically. Remember that as the water bearer, Aquarius has within it wells of untapped emotional capacity. Only, unlike any other sign, Aquarius shoulders these emotional conditions with impenetrable strength and understanding, turning them into nutrient, tilling human soil, watering it with compassion. In this alchemical process, all human experience, the sordid and splendid, meet their highest resolution in the arms of Aquarius.

Personally I don't believe in astrology (I am a physics major and learned about the stars from that perspective), but I really like her and I would like to give astrology a chance... for her. I need a few questions answered before I can start my journey into astrology.I am NOT saying that the location of planets during our birth doesn't have an impact on our lives, but rather I don't have a reason to believe that it does.It seems as though Astrology offers answers to very big and important questions such as who we are and why we act in particular ways, but I don't understand how it is able to make these claims.I have read articles that claim certain configurations of the planets and the sun have \"X\" effects on our personality, but these articles NEVER explain how or why the location of the planets have these impacts on our lives. I am beginning to think that there might not be an explanation to be given.Question: Does the Astrology offer science driven reasons for why the location of a planet(s) or the sun during our births directly impact  our lives or why they have the effects that Astrology claims?Without an understanding of why \"the location of mars\" during my birth makes my personality more or less aggressive, then I can't help but DEFAULT to believing that astrology is \"faith-based philosophy\" that is closer to religion than science. Therefore the claims astrology makes is based on faith rather the cold unrelenting logic of science.TLDR; GF REALLY likes astrology. I like GF. GF wants me to like astrology.

For example,  I looked at the time periods when: my parents got divorced, when I entered college, when I entered my first major relationship, and so on.Especially if you just look at the outer planets, you can get an idea for the major themes that were being communicated to you through these ongoing transits. AND\/OR, figure out which planet(s) have the most influence in your chart by tracking your rulership (for instance, if you have mercury and sun in Aquarius, those planets will be under the rulership of Uranus. The planet with the most bodies in its sign will have the greatest influence). You can also look at the traditional \"chart ruler\", which is the planet ruling your ascendant. (For me, I don't feel this resonates as well, as the majority of my planets are grouped under Aq. and Capr., making Saturn and Uranus the overwhelming influencers) You could really do this for any planet, but obviously the planets with longer transit periods are going to communicate a larger theme\/phase.I found that, looking at what house and sign these planets were traveling through, they corresponded to the major \"phases\" of my life so far. As they moved through the house, I dealt with different events, emotional journeys, and lessons, that lined up significantly with the themes of the house (obviously). Who I was at the start of the phase was quite different to who I was by the end of the phase. (FYI, I am using Whole sign houses, so it makes it much easier\/clearer to interpret these transits as phases)Here's a personal example for those that are interested:Right around when I first met my now-husband, Saturn was just moving into my 7th house in Scorpio. The major theme and lessons of the first part of our relationship dealt with helping each other heal from our respective traumas, learning how to manage our emotions, how to cooperate with each other, and that a relationship should not have to be a constant power struggle. During this period, a few of my family members also died. I inherited some money from my parents (which I dwindled unwisely on a drug problem).As Saturn moved on into 8H Sagittarius, this was the point where me and my husband left a city that was toxic for us (where we were living in addiction), and moved back to my hometown where we started building up our lives for the better. And during this period, I enrolled back in college as I wanted to empower myself to get better employment and to work in a field that meant something to me.I'm sure that I'm not the first person to think of doing this, but I thought I'd share it with others. Exploring Astrology like this was a very accessible way to understand the energies of transits as they play out in real life, because I had that experience myself. Not only that, but it helped me understand myself, and the energies of my chart, as well.Good luck!","title-cc":148,"title-wc":25,"body-cc":2989,"body-wc":539,"media":0,"comments":34},"1902":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"Lighters I made for my friend\u2019s birthday inspired by his chart","body-text":"","title-cc":62,"title-wc":12,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":32},"1903":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Looks like we are hitting another interesting super moon.

Financial systems and food production may be in for a shock, since Uranus can bring instability, but this may be necessary to shake us from our complacency. On a personal level, many of us are looking for an improvement in our values and attitudes towards money and the methods we use to survive.Uranus and Taurus are an interesting combination to attempt to fathom. Taurus the sign that, out of the entire zodiac, is the most resistant to change meets the planet that insists upon it. Uranus challenges the status quo and forces both the individual and society to change and, in particular, to break from the past. From the purely Uranian point of view, clinging to the past can only hinder progress. From the deliberate, enduring, and persistent Taurean viewpoint, change not only might topple the much-beloved quiet life, it also threatens the most important thing of all: security.A dynamic square aspect between these two highly energized planets on May 16. Forecasts for the Uranus in Taurus years (May 2017 through April 2026) include financial upheaval, radical environmental changes, and a revolution in how we handle the planet\u2019s resources. Uranus last traveled through Taurus from June 1934 to May 1942; in 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act and the Social Security Act, both of which significantly altered how U.S. citizens handled their savings. It also saw\u00a0the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936), Japan\u2019s invasion of China (1937), the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland (1939), and much activity from Nazi Germany, with finally the outbreak of World War II in 1939. From a Uranus in Taurus point of view, many of these happenings changed borders; land ownership changed hands. The way in which land was used also changed in several European countries.\u00a0Uranus in Taurus might well deliver all sorts of changes to various economic systems, but perhaps more interesting will be the changes in how we use our resources; how we use, make, and spend our money and what we spend it on. With Uranus, we know to expect more technology in the making and spending\u00a0of money.The ingress of an outer planet into a new sign often coincides with major world events. The very day that Uranus entered Aries (March 11, 2011), an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, triggering the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\u00a0Uranus in Taurus does give rise to individuals feeling that they are trapped by debt and that money is not offering them the freedom they would like, this could create tremendous growth in so-called sharing economies, or what some people call \u201ccollaborative consumerism\u201d \u2014 the idea being that individuals can rent out their car, their bike, their apartment, their computer, almost anything, when they are not using it. With Uranus entering Taurus, in addition to possible Earth changes, we could see shake-ups in the financial world. Disruptors of the financial status quo are already at play and likely to gain traction: cryptocurrencies, micro-banking, crowdfunding. We may see grassroots movements to free humanity from the control of the banking system, and free the Earth from an economy based on extracting and exploiting resources. On a personal level, we could become aware of the ways we feel restricted when it comes to money, and take steps toward liberation. Relationships and sexuality are also ripe for revolution, and we can expect trends like polyamory, ethical non-monogamy and sacred sexuality to continue to rise","title-cc":146,"title-wc":25,"body-cc":3557,"body-wc":597,"media":0,"comments":37},"1911":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"what does it mean to have a mars ruled venus? and how do you know where you fall?","body-text":"","title-cc":81,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":108},"1912":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Has anyone else been feeling extra tired\/groggy lately?","body-text":"I woke up at noon today which means I slept almost 12 hours last night and I still feel tired.

I would tend to agree with them. Yet, I think most of us would agree that astrology works. How do we make sense of the lack of mechanism?I came to astrology 23 years ago simply to disprove it to my \"new age\" girlfriend. I was a rational, materialistic atheist who didn't believe in ANYTHING outside the rigid worldview of physics. Since then, I have been falling deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of astrology, numerology and tarot.It still doesn't make any sense WHY this stuff works. There is no reason for a dwarf planet orbiting billions of miles away to have ANY effect. It just doesn't make sense.Why are humans hardwired to assume their roles as actors in this archetypal storyline that exists across all cultures spanning thousands of years?Why should a newborn baby with Chiron squaring Saturn on his IC have an extremely difficult childhood preordained?  Why should being born premature have such a monumental effect on the child's personality even though the DNA remains the same?It seems the only logical explanation why we are dancing this archetypal dance with each other with preordained obstacles is that we are living in a simulation.  Why else would tarot work? Why would witchcraft work? Somehow our intentions and beliefs can influence the world of physical matter. It seems that the placebo effect also needs an explanation that our current medical understanding cannot explain.Although I have no actual proof that we are living in a simulation, it seems that we live in a world where our intentions act as a physical force, moving us into different parallel timelines.When I was a teenager, I was sitting at home watching TV one day. I decided to draw both sides of a $1 coin on a sheet of paper.  I proceeded to flip the coin and tried to guess the outcome. I would keep my hand over the coin and stare at the paper in a mild trance. I could see what looked like heat waves going to the correct answer.Things started to get freaky when I started to notice how many correct answers in a row I was able to guess. As long as I was guessing the flips absentmindedly, I was getting correct answers. As soon as I became aware of the unlikely probability that I guessed a series correctly, the VERY NEXT GUESS was wrong, EVERY TIME. It was like my consciousness was breaking the streak. After a half hour of absentmindedly guessing flips while watching TV, I managed to guess 20 flips in a row. I was trying to ignore the math, but my rational mind freaked out. The statistical probability of that happening is 1 in 1,048,576.That was 30 years ago and it put a seed in my mind that there was SOMETHING going on that I could not explain. Even to this day, I can still correctly guess coin flips ONLY when I am not trying. I can't record it. I can't have a witness. I can't give a shit about the outcome. That is the only way it works. Either we live in a simulation or I was able to move my consciousness into alternative timelines at will. Maybe both are true.","title-cc":52,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":3091,"body-wc":563,"media":0,"comments":91},"1915":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"JoJo (Singer) And the Blessing of the Saturn Return.","body-text":"Edit: Posted this on Twitter and JoJo read and responded! She found it fascinating and loves astrology \ud83e\udd70\u2728Random but it had to be written. UPROXX recently uploaded a short documentary on JoJo and it resonated so well with what I saw in her chart, rated AA.At 13, JoJo experienced massive success (2nd house profection year, hers ruled by expansive Jupiter, which trines her MC--more on that later), but was subsequently held hostage by a greedy (and now defunct) music label. As a result, she couldn't release music for more than a decade.JoJo is an Aquarius Rising, and her Saturn is at 24 degrees of Capricorn, placing it in the 12th. When the ruling planet of the ASC is averse or \"hidden\" from the ASC, a theme of \"delay\" can prevail, as the steersman of your ship cannot see where it is going. Very frustrating. In JoJo's case, it is further compounded by the fact that her ASC ruler is the planet of delay and restriction. And that is further compounded by the fact that its a 12th house placement of loss. Whew!In the midst of recording additional songs, her label dissolved (12th), yet she was still bound (Saturn) by the terms in her contract. She continued to record music but was not allowed to release any of it. We need to note that JoJo has a massive 12th house Capricorn stellium--Mercury RX, Venus, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus and NN. That she was forced into relative obscurity reinforces 12th house themes of things hidden, things ending, doing things in secret. Music studios are also the 12th house--forced creative isolation. She remarked in the documentary that she would constantly read articles that proclaimed she must have died. She recalled how frustrating it was to see musicians who started after her start to pass and out-succeed her. (Personally, this is such a huge Saturn struggle. It is the bane of my existence. Anyway....)JoJo has Neptune and Venus closely conjunct in the 12th. In the documentary, she was gaslit into taking medication to make her thinner, under the guise that her label just wanted her to be \"healthy\". The fogginess of Neptune playing out next to her creative planet, Venus, is also indicative of being sold a bill of goods that never comes to be. In the beginning, she was very glamourized by Hollywood, private jets, opening for Usher, etc.--but when the fog settled, she was completely and utterly screwed by signing that contract: Mercury RX in the 12th. RX Mercury begs of you to dive into the details, to double check, to be sure, transit or natal. And music contracts are complicated and obtuse already. Placed in the 12th, she became a victim of her own pen. (Not blaming her, by the way.)What ensued were years of substance abuse, another 12th house theme, especially with Venus ad Neptune co present. Unable to release or perform music, JoJo became \"a shell of herself\" and had to be \"buzzed\" in order to function. Only the realization that her dad was an addict (who died of his addiction it seemed--went to sleep and never woke up) snapped her back into reality, and she begun to take control. She hired a lawyer and became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with her former label. Her Venus, in the 12th and conj. Neptune, rules her 9th house Libra of contracts, law, legal endeavors. So she was in for an uphill battle. But she has Mars square her ASC, which, yes, can render one a victim to martial energies from others (her label), but also energizes you for battle as a result. In Taurus, it also meant\/means she has to fight for her art.In the meantime, she decided to release free mixtapes. A Saturn theme is stripping down to bare essentials. Ideally wanting to release music for profit, she had to settle for releasing music for free, and self-funding a lot of her creative endeavors. Though not firmly in her Saturn Return when she released these mixtapes, Saturn themes prevail for as it is her final dispositor.Anyway, the story gets happier. In 2014, she was freed from her contract. It was a 12th house profection year, and during Capricorn season. So matters of the 12th house were doubly activated. And Saturn lurked still behind it all. Mars trine Saturn natives also never give up no matter how steep the odds are stacked. Go JoJo!\"Just imagine how the free bird will sing after being caged for so long,\" wrote one reporter. Holy 12th house! Only now, instead of entering a prison, she was leaving it. And thus began a new cycle for her, as she entered a 1st house year soon after. She signed to Atlantic Records.","title-cc":52,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":4495,"body-wc":802,"media":0,"comments":30},"1916":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"I love astrology, but seeing actual photos of the planets freaks me out.","body-text":"This is so random, but is anyone else freaked out by seeing pictures of the planets?

We all know fixed energy is rigid, controlled, stubborn, and stable. Air energy is intellectual, communicative, logical, and objective. By these standards, Aquarius energy is a rigid thinker, someone who has stable (Saturn ruled) ideas (air) that they are unwilling to change. There is also the humanitarian aspect of Aquarius which comes from the Sun (self) being in detriment there (opposite Leo).When it comes to modern astrology, people take the Uranus keywords and associate those with Aquarius: the oddball, the actvist of social change, the unconventional thinker.To me, this traditional description of Aquarius and modern description of Aquarius seem like complete opposites. Uranus does not feel like a fixed planet to me at all (perhaps the most unfixed planet of all as it is all about social upheaval and change), so why does it \"rule\" a fixed sign in modern astrology?My question is: What is Aquarius energy to you and what can you say about different planets in Aquarius and what can you say about Aquarius energy ruling different houses?

Keep in mind these themes may be applicable for the next year and a half, as eclipses light up the Capricorn-Cancer axis in your chart.)Aries: Big one for you Aries. Happening in your angular 10th house of career and status, this eclipse can bring about monumental change in the work you do in the world and how you are seen, received and praised for it. It may have the power to catapult you into success, so long as you have the Capricorn work ethic and integrity to back it up and don\u2019t stop short to start something else. Otherwise, an eclipse here may teach you to be a bit more methodical about your work in the world, going about it with backbreaking diligence, and learning to find success through the accomplishments of smaller goals that accumulate over time. It will call for an organization of your efforts and an attention to the details of your dreams. In some cases, you may experience a breakthrough or breakdown with a boss\/mentor\/father-like figure. Or even a sudden change wherein you are the boss or have the final say. But do not despair, anything that seems to fall apart here is creating space for something better to take its place. With transit Saturn and Pluto already here, this eclipse will give you the energy to eliminate or make you aware of useless endeavors. And to move forward onto the world stage with the part you\u2019re meant to play, and the power of conviction to know you\u2019re making the right choices.Taurus: The eclipse in your 9th house, dear Taurus, represents a new vantage point through which to view your beliefs and your ingrained ideologies. Perhaps a gateway will open up, allowing those things foreign to you and your experience to settle in and teach you new ways. Movement in the 9th house always confronts what you believe to be true. Where you are rigid in your spiritual or religious pursuits, the eclipse may ask for flexibility. Where you lack follow-through in these areas, then discipline. Where can the altars of your mind be dusted off, where can new magic seep in? It may be that your worldview needs more scope, so that it can expand and change as you grow. This may be done, perhaps, through travel or committing to higher education. But whether your trips are internal or external, this eclipse dusts off your proverbial suitcase, asking what deserves to travel with and inform you on this journey of life. Bon voyage!Gemini: The Capricorn partial Solar Eclipse will be happening in your 8th house of joint resources, shared belongings, intimacy and occult matters. This eclipse will enlighten within you new ways to ask for what you need, share what you have and start confronting any financial issues (debt, inheritances, scholarships, savings, deeds, loans, etc.) that are stopping you from living comfortably. The eclipse will ask you to set new goals and intentions in these areas, and commit to correcting them with dutiful action. Issues of worth don\u2019t only pertain to our physical or monetary possessions, but also the worth of our stories, our pain, our trauma, and how when shared, they become transformed. Our most intimate bonds are those in which we reveal layers of ourselves with others, transmuting vulnerability into a super power. The eclipse here may bring to the forefront intimacy issues you have with others (or yourself), where you may have one foot out of the door instead of fully committing to being seen. In Capricorn, this is practical. We share our stories with those who deserve to hear them, and over time, strengthen our trust in these areas. 8th house is also said to be rich with mystery, sometimes a conduit to otherworldly matters. Set up a shrine, hold a crystal, meditate on a thought or intention, and open yourself up to communication from your cosmic companions.Cancer: This partial Solar Eclipse will place emphasis on your 7th house of relationships with others. Relationships can be business, romantic, or platonic in nature. With Saturn and Pluto already firmly planted here, you may have found your relationships challenging or requiring that you grow beyond ingrained patterns. You may have even found that you\u2019ve been attracted to powerful and consequential people who irritate your more soft sensibilities. This eclipse is a New Moon, and in your relationship house, opens up a portal through which you can experience your relationships differently, out from power struggles and into feeling empowered. New Moons can also bring in new things, so you may even expect to attract alliances that are more in line with the power you are coming into now and the person you want to be. It is very influential to have an eclipse happening in an angular house, so you more than most signs can expect to feel this eclipse more strongly. Commit to building powerful and productive relationships, and sweeping away the old and tired dynamics tying you to any drama in this area.","title-cc":81,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":5065,"body-wc":880,"media":0,"comments":59},"1939":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"Did you know that \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u201d was representation of the life of a Capricorn?","body-text":"","title-cc":102,"title-wc":18,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":42},"1940":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"The clearest picture of mercury available","body-text":"","title-cc":41,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":7},"1942":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"When my friends Ask how astrology works, and whats going on right now","body-text":"","title-cc":69,"title-wc":13,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":11},"1943":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Scorpio Rising appearance types: the \"Scorpion\" vs the \"Eagle\"","body-text":"I want to credit \/u\/suneasy for asking the question in an earlier post.As far as I know there are traditionally two types of appearances associated with Scorpio rising - the \"Scorpion\" or the \"Eagle.\" It's interesting because both animals are symbols associated with different manifestations of the Scorpio mythology.   Of course, there are also many Scorpio risings who are a mix or look different based on other planetary influences, but these are the two 'typical' appearances seen with the sign.The \"Scorpion\" ascendant typically has the heartier appearance; they look swarthier, have broader\/more full face structures, a longer mouth and give a suggestion of the strong energy and appetites of the sign, even as they retain the classical piercing eyes and sharp eyebrows.  I consider this a Mars-manifestation of the sign, since Mars as co-ruler of Scorpio reflects its fixed and strong appetite and energy, and also its willingness to externally and enthusiastically apply that energy.Examples of the \"Scorpion\":-Argentinian famous footballer Diego Maradona-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher-American Politician Hillary Clinton-Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini-Ex-media mogul Harvey WeinsteinThe \"Eagle\" ascendant has a typically thinner, but also more edgy or intense appearance; their head is often thinner than the \"Scorpion\" but the bones can appear sharper, and in particular they often have a strongly defined 'beak-like' nose (or if it's not beak-like or protruding, at least it appears sharp), with piercing eyes and strongly curved eyebrows set closely on them.  The eyebrow ridge is often also set straight at the top of the nose bridge and can appear to 'dig into' it, even as an eagle's, to give the eyes a more piercing appearance.  Unlike the \"Scorpion,\" the \"Eagle\" type has a 'tighter', smaller mouth; as opposed to the Mars-type energy of the \"Scorpion\", this feels more Pluto-like to me, reflecting the restrain and control of that planet, yet underlying a strong and hypnotic intensity\/reserve underneath.  Very similar to an actual eagle that closely observes things and then 'strikes' when ready.  It's kind of funny because unlike the Scorpion types, Eagle types really DO look like an Eagle!","title-cc":62,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":2234,"body-wc":362,"media":0,"comments":67},"1944":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Husband bought a computer during mercury retrograde","body-text":"For about a year my husband has been borrowing my computer and I finally put my foot down last week as he can afford and needs a computer of his own.

I've had my Venus conjunct, sextile, and square others' Mars before and it's really hard to deny that the natural chemistry.

On its own, Sagittarius is the sign of change, exploration, and a search for truth. Couple that with an eclipse, which brings beginnings\/endings, life-changing events, and truth to the things we\u2019ve kept in the dark this one will be especially powerful.Normally we have 4 eclipse in a year, 2020 had 6. These corresponded to rising tensions in Iran, BLM protests, TikTok ruining a Trump Rally, Supreme Court dismissing GOP fake election lawsuit, and AG Bill Bar resigning. So- big things.This lunar eclipse also has a Saturn square Uranus aspect joining in its transformative nature. When Saturn squares Uranus, it creates great tension in your life and a feeling for a desire for change that is constantly being thwarted by your circumstances. But if you avoid this change, then some crises will happen suddenly and force you to change.In addition to the Saturn\/Uranus square we have Neptune square with Mercury\/Venus. This is creating anxiety, misconceptions, miscommunications, and unrealistic attitudes with relationships and reality and is testing our acceptance of others in this time. It\u2019s aggressive, powerful, and fucking choatic.Just remember that this too shall pass. Often we see change with a negative connotation, but remember there is no growth without change. This full moon will allow us to see what we need to change to find our truth. If you didn\u2019t do your spring cleaning, the universe is about to do it for you.Lean into the change. Remember that this is giving you the chance to clean out things that aren\u2019t working to make room for new and better things. Simply be patient and observe. It is recommended you don\u2019t try to implement any new changes until June 2nd when Neptune will be trine Venus.Embrace the chaos. Enjoy the ride.

While someone else may buy a house and the land on it (and it possibly could seem easier to do so) the carpenter is able to design his home how he likes and take pride in it once it is complete.On top of that, he will know how to repair his home once it is finished, as he already has mapped the insides and exterior. It is his home. The difficulties may have been presented to him, but he used those experiences to his advantage in order to become what he is today. His wisdom and knowledge were developed through opposition - instead of feeling sorry for himself, he embraced it.In a similar manner, a bridge is useless unless there is tension. Not enough, and the bridge collapses. Hardship can be utilized for the better of the self, or the worse; everyone needs to accept this. We are responsible for the world we live in, and if we want to live in a state of self loathing and complete despair, than consequences will follow.","title-cc":41,"title-wc":9,"body-cc":1170,"body-wc":217,"media":0,"comments":89},"2008":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"Do you ever tell anyone you're into astrology?","body-text":"I feel like telling your friends \"yhea, I'm into astrology\" puts you in the same category as conspiracy theorists and anti vaxxers.Even if you tell them they're natal chart and pin point their personality word for word they may still think it's bs.

As long as it's consensual you can love and fuck whoever you want. Also Neptune deals with glamour, poetry, music, theater, fashion, dance and other fine arts which a lot of queer people, especially gay men, are known to love.

Put that all together and it makes sense why so many Zoomers are LGBTQ or LGBTQ allies.

It allows you to think differently, more creatively and spontaneously, but then this can lead into delusions.  Obviously stimulants = mars.  What about psychedelics?  They expand your mind.  They just intensify every aspect of your psyche, your emotions become more intense, your thoughts race, and your true self becomes more apparent.  This sounds like Pluto.

They are in almost every topic related to it, and that happens because of 2 main reasons: \u2013 a lack of 360\u02da knowledge of the esoteric matters and a superficial approach in a matter which would request great depth instead.\u00a0So, many \u201cprofane astrologers\u201d, as I define them, wrote a lot of \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d books full of oversimplifications and superficial interpretations and that helped in spreading misconceptions everywhere.Of course, one of the fields of Astrology with the most part of misconceptions is the treatment of the 12 Zodiacal Signs and their basic personalities. It\u2019s perfectly normal because the Zodiac Sign is the first, and often the only, thing which interests the mainstream audience.And that\u2019s why so many times I heard something like: \u2013 \u201cAre you a Taurus?

Let\u2019s start with the first one immediately.\u2022 Geminis are double-faced persons.This is one of the most superficial misconceptions about a Zodiacal Sign that exists; it\u2019s the classic \u201ccook-book\u201d astrology interpretation or something for amateurs. Obviously, that originates from the distorted meaning of the archetypal imagine attributed to Gemini, namely, the Twins.The image of the twins is roughly perceived as 2 identical persons who are even distinct from each other, and this is simplistically interpreted as a signal of a double-personality, so this character trait is attributed to Gemini persons.","title-cc":122,"title-wc":19,"body-cc":1808,"body-wc":293,"media":0,"comments":68},"2030":{"time":"2020-09-10","title":"About Posting Personal Charts","body-text":"I know that all the rules are lifted for another ten days as far as I'm aware.But could we just avoid fucking up this experiment?I'm talking about the personal charts.And I can't be the only one who is already getting bugged by seeing the number of them grow in the feed.I know you're curious about something in your chart.

Squares\/Oppositions","body-text":"Hi everyone!Trine\/Sextile Vs. Squares\/Oppositions hold a stereotype like countless other items in astrology. We cringe at the red and embrace the blue. In laymen's terms, one set seems more desirable than the other.With that said, I feel a sense of distortion between what is 'good' and 'bad' within these definitions and was hoping to form a discussion about it.From reading countless charts from both personal friends and public figures alike, I've grown to understand the trine\/sextile as an energy which flows directly. Whilst this may indicate 'ease' in the individual's life, I'm not necessarily convinced that this may translate as percieved good. For example, the \"ease\" of trines can lead to laziness and passivity. When used negatively, trines can be used to hurt others for personal gain, and these ventures can reach untouchable success.Squares seem to make the individual aware of a problem which exists either within them, their external environment or both. Squares call on us to try and try again. The problem with a square is that it doesn't allow us to get lazy. Ignore the square and the square will retaliate. Understand the square, and what is gained is immeasurable maturity, perspective and potential success. The Square presents an obstacle, but an obstacle that's designed to elevate us further.Oppositions seem similar, but to me, they show a different dynamic. To me, oppositions feel like an island across the ocean. Unlike a square, you can see the other side - but you can't swim there. You can just observe and try to communicate to the horizon from a distance. Oppositions feel weirdly confrontational, but in a \"we need to see this from a different angle\" type of way. To me, if a square represents an obstacle to overcome, then an opposition represents the same, but sourced from the external. An opposition will quite literally hand you the answer, sometimes in the most brutal way - it just often takes a few lifetimes to realise quite what the question is.This may be getting a bit \"karmic\" but I think that Trines\/Sextiles are tests on reward, whilst Squares\/Oppositions are tests on trial. I saw this beautiful quote from Paulo Coelho which sums up the dynamic pretty well \u201cLife has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.\u201dWhat are your thoughts?","title-cc":54,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":2366,"body-wc":404,"media":0,"comments":31},"2037":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"Saturn in Aquarius gang where y\u2019all at","body-text":"How\u2019s the Saturn return going?Mines in 6th house.

This is period that, in my experience, gives Mercury retrograde such bad name.  So, now we have a new vision for the future.  But we can't act on it yet!  Here are some pieces of wisdom for navigating this time, from Erin Sullivan's book, Retrograde Planets:-Impatience arises easily at this stage, but hastening the process simply will not work-Be experimental, yet cautious-Actively lay the groundwork for the future by being passively receptive to the current conditions; don\u2019t sign contracts or initiate new enterprises or make major purchases-Exciting energy of new beginnings is combined with a sense of restraint and this creates tension-Develop new potentials, options and opportunities-By not making major decisions and resisting the impulse to wade in, one contains one\u2019s anxiety and builds a more appropriate method of operation (the frequent repercussions from a Promethean impetuousness have given Mercury retrograde a bad name)-The mind is gradually acquiring the information and perspective that the will should exercise when the direct cycle begins after the station-direct","title-cc":63,"title-wc":11,"body-cc":2034,"body-wc":340,"media":0,"comments":31},"2043":{"time":"2016-10-01","title":"Made a painting for my Scorpio girlfriend..

Saturn rules the structural elements of our life, earth & administration. It gives us the perseverance to create the very foundations of our existence - our boundaries, our rules, our career, our body, building blocks of our life that let us function effectively & bring our talents our soul to material world.During the retrograde period Saturn holds up external launch of new structure of our life cause it hits resistance within our inner life which if not removed won\u2019t allow us to live that external reality with full potency & success. So last 4-5 months has been period of internal restructuring, frustration, resentment, arrested growth but at the same time rebuilding of a new rule book, warding out things \/ attitudes \/ people which are obstacles to our ability to take on this new responsibility & opportunity of new structure of our life. Saturn in retrograde stage breaks down our ego & sometimes negativity which is accumulated which keeps us away from assimilating our ideal with material. Unknowingly in past few months we have created a new code of conduct, a new unsaid boundary of what we would or would not accept going forward in our life.That\u2019s the thing with Saturn - a lot is unsaid & understated - yet without its work we wouldn\u2019t accomplish anything in material or spiritual world as it creates a mountain of persistence within us so doing the requisite work for accomplishing what we need becomes part of our DNA.The Mythology and it\u2019s physical realityIn Hindu mythology Saturn is represented as Kurma, tortoise - an incarnation of Lord Vishnu (the creator), who lifted the mountain so Gods could churn the ocean to retrieve the usefulness - usefulness is born due to work we do under the influence of Saturn - so past four months have been our own individual process of creating inner strength to lift up our own mountains.And now with Saturn going direct we have a lift off. It\u2019s time to lift that mountain so usefulness is birthed. As Saturn is in Capricorn no matter where you are lifting your mountain it would have influence of solidifying your professional foundations, your foundations as a leader of whatever domain you might be looking to be the lead on - efficiency is birthed - core strength is born to be the kind of leader of our personal or professional life that knows when to say no and draw healthy boundaries. The leader who knows what to choose, what to Detox, what to move away from as it doesn\u2019t have longevity & to move to what has grounding to survive the next 30 years of our evolution which we are moving towards.Saturn will retrace the path it traversed since 29 April from now to Christmas - making visible changes in framework of our life to reflect the inner re-engineering it has done in last four months. Imagine last four months as you going through process of rewriting the rules of your life - what profession, life commitment to whom, what to say yes to what not to when it comes to responsibilities, what you need for your material growth & Stability - imagine now that rule book being implemented. The theory merging with action till December. As soon as Saturn is done with this journey we would have a Solar eclipse on 26 Dec\u201919 prompting us - your new life is ready now to be lived - it becomes our new reality.Saturn churning turning direct is subtle as is the planet itself but its gifts are real, material, Long lasting - this is about getting what we need & it might come in forms different from what we want. Saturn is like a responsible parent - it knows well to give you time to adjust to what it\u2019s about to unfold as your new path which it was doing in last four months - but it also knows well to also give you what you truly need & what\u2019s right for you. Cause sometimes what we want is not what we need. Hence the delay, hence the need of time, hence the retrograde but that\u2019s why what\u2019s created gives benefits for a life time.So over next 14 weeks, we will see structure of our life change in ways we didn\u2019t originally plan but over last four months we have been internal restructured to move from what we wanted to what we truly need - some call it reality checks, some call it maturing a dream.","title-cc":54,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":4271,"body-wc":759,"media":0,"comments":33},"2081":{"time":"2022-01-03","title":"April 12 2022","body-text":"i keep seeing a lot of talk about this date because jupiter conjuncts neptune in pisces which seems to be a pretty rare event. does anyone have a better description of exactly what this will look like or what specifics in a chart should be looked at to gain more insight on what this will look like for individuals?","title-cc":13,"title-wc":3,"body-cc":315,"body-wc":59,"media":0,"comments":139},"2082":{"time":"2021-10-05","title":"What do you wish you were taught when starting out?","body-text":"Whats a piece of knowledge or advice you wish someone would have given to you when you started to learn astrology?

I've read my fair share of books and materials and from my experience it's a good tool to know yourself better, but definitely not something to fanatically dive into everyday. I wanted to say this as just a suggestion probably. Don't compare yourself or rely on other people's situations that you see here. Your life is a personal experience no matter how close your natal chart is to someone else is. On a more astrological side, the \"bad\" transits will always be there, ongoing. Don't wait for them to end, learn from them. Most importantly listen to yourself, body and spirit. There lie all the answers. There are many gifts in your natal chart that you will carry all your life. Learn to use and improve them, instead of waiting for a certain period to end.

Why it may not be as obvious and cliche as you think","body-text":"Approaching this upcoming notorious Saturn\/Pluto conjunction, I have been seeing a lot of posts on different platforms talking about power and how to not give your power away to anyone else.  In other words, the real power comes from inside yourself, and anything coming from something outside yourself is limiting your own power.At first glance, I always considered myself as someone who was \"above\" anything that would normally be perceived as authority.  For example, I have always seen my parents and older family members as equals to me.  And at work, I have always proudly considered myself to not be a victim of the manager's influence. Even when it came to taking drugs, I always knew confidently that I can live with or without them, and the choice was always up to me.So when I would see these messages about not giving away your power, I would naturally think this doesn't really apply to me.  I could check that box off my \"to do\" list.However, this past year, having done more internal work on my fears than ever before, I realized there had been an elephant in the room my entire life that I had been giving my power to.The best way I can describe it is that I always felt I had been banished to live within certain limits.  Growing up in a lower middle class environment, I just always assumed that I was never going to be \"one of those\" people.  Some people lived a great life who got to have all of the nice things, with a family, a nice house, a nice car, and a job that they loved. But I was not one of those.I created this \"phantom God\" in my mind, who limited my existence to where I could only live in apartments and work minimum wage jobs.  Maybe if I were really lucky, I would be able to even have a spouse that loved me.  But overall, I was to live in this small circle of limitations, and other people were living beyond the circle.So when you think of who is really controlling you, it might not be as obvious as you think.  It might not be an authority figure that you can point to and say \"There! That's it!\".  It might be something much more ethereal and vague than you could have imagined consciously.","title-cc":89,"title-wc":20,"body-cc":2133,"body-wc":399,"media":0,"comments":101},"2098":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Moon-Venus conjunction in Aquarius about 9h ago - who was creative?","body-text":"","title-cc":67,"title-wc":11,"body-cc":0,"body-wc":0,"media":1,"comments":47},"2099":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Transit Guide for Beginners (5 Steps)","body-text":"There\u2019s two kinds of Transits you can look at:a) by ASPECT: the planets in their current position in the sky (= \u201ctransit planets\u201d) making aspects to the planets\u2019 position from the time when you were born  (= \u201cnatal planets\u201d). They can aspect one or more planets in your natal Chart. The nature of the Transit will be shown by the basic energies of all planets involved, as well as the nature of the aspect. Generally harmonious aspects feel smooth, empowering and rather pleasant while disharmonious aspects may feel frustrating, threatening and generally unsettling. Remember though: transits show the kind energy that is currently in your life - they never show the outcome and the way you deal with it is up to you always. By showing you what is going on in your life, astrology can guide you to work with these energies instead of against them.\u201cHarmonious\u201d = trine, sextile, (sometimes conjunction, depending on the planets involved)\u201cDisharmonious\u201d= opposition, square, inconjunction, (sometimes conjunction)PS. You can also look at minor aspects  (above I only listed the major aspects). As a beginner, I\u2019d suggest starting with the major aspects, though)b) by HOUSE: as the planets are constantly moving they will basically transit counter-clockwise through your natal Chart over the years. Due to their difference in speed, this will take them a different amount of time. Thus, the Moon (fastest moving planet) moves through your whole Chart every 28 days while Pluto (slowest) takes around 250 years (in 2. I will explain why this is important). The current House the planets are transiting through will show you the area of life where that planet\u2019s energy will be showing up, asking to be integrated. Usually the transit feels stronger at the beginning of the House and the effects lessen once the planet has traveled towards the end of the House, about to enter the new one. During its stay in each House you have the opportunity to individually learn about and integrate the themes of the planet + the House (i.e. Pluto in 1st House = Transformation (Pluto) of the Self (1H) or Jupiter (expansion) in the area of 4H (family, roots).1H = (AC) the self, identity, physical constitution, birth, conditioning, beginnings2H = money, income, values, self worth, your belongings, resources, real estate, living conditions, shelter, food, the body","title-cc":37,"title-wc":6,"body-cc":2350,"body-wc":387,"media":0,"comments":30},"2100":{"time":"2021-09-05","title":"Unpopular opinion: All these full\/new moons are the same.","body-text":"I know full moons and new moons are seemingly different but to me it\u2019s always the same message.\u201cClear out the past situations.

What drama are you currently embroiled in? What cast of characters are off-script? Or is it a soliloquy, a one man show diving deep into the players of your own psyche? October 24th marks a halfway point to these stories, but not an intermission. Stay seated, stay grounded. This is the Taurus way.This lunation is ruled, again, by a retrograde Venus (now at 4 degrees of Scorpio), injecting themes of love, romance, relationship and value into our emotional awareness. In Taurus, these themes will be apparent and solid, brought down from the ethereal into real, from ideas into practice, and from hopes into reality. That is the groudedness of Taurus, a place where the moon delights. Where the Venus-ruled New Moon in Libra had us grappling with thoughts or concepts, the idea of balance and reciprocity, and initiations of what we want to come, Taurus will now have us grappling with what is.We know by now that the retrograde movement by Venus in Scorpio is unearthing all of our junk. And if we\u2019ve been good celestial students, we have been confronting the shadows and blind spots that do not serve our highest good when it comes to Love with a capital L. It is no coincidence, then, that this Full Moon is known as a Hunter\u2019s Moon. It is the time, metaphorically, where we seek for those things that will fatten and insulate us through the winter\u2014so apropos for Taurus. RX Venus in a Mars-ruled sign is that hunter, seeking for those things that will fill us up, nourish us, and get us through\u2014if not first by identifying those things that won\u2019t. What is learned here can insulate these areas of your life, cushioning and comforting you with new understanding.Into the specifics...Retrograde Uranus accompanies this moon at 0 degrees of Taurus. Uranus is the element of surprise, and full moons always illuminate what was kept under cover of darkness. This could be the about-face, the sharp left out of left field that turns up the stakes in this story. Easily, this subverts the stability of Taurus: two left feet, everything left topsy-turvy. But what is realized, whatever honesty or bluntness or change or shock that is endured here can become the foil to our hero\u2019s journey, the motivating factor that then fortifies our way forward into a just and peaceful result (Venus). And this could be an internal struggle, a sudden insight or understanding brought forth from you to you, the most important relationship of all. A Sun to Uranus opposition here (1 degree orb) invigorates our will and ego, encouraging us to try something different, assert ourselves in new ways. Uranus helps us to be the change we wish to see in our lives, or else invites us to accept the ones that come. As with any opposition: moderation. May your revolution be soft. Let the Moon in Taurus ground you through any upset, and help you take plot twists in stride. The story isn\u2019t over. Root and regroup.All this reckoning could use a backbone. Saturn enters scene at 4 degrees of Capricorn, forming both a sextile to Venus and trine to the Moon. As James Brown would say, \u201cPapa don\u2019t take no mess!\u201d Meaning both, Saturn energy won\u2019t allow you to be knocked around and that Saturn energy won\u2019t allow you to fool around. Saturn contacts to softies Venus and Moon can be serious and sober, but the light touch of a sextile and trine ensures these are supportive ones. Saturn in Capricorn loves building things, strong things. This sets the stage for more mature perspectives on love and value, ones that take into account the long view. It is what we build here, right now, that can carry us forth into strong new beginnings and behaviors. Saturn asks us to manage our boundaries, where we have too little or too many. Where we are too allowing, or too restricted. Can we manage our expectations where they may be too high or too low? Saturn reinforces, so make sure you pour your concrete exactly how you want it before it dries.Lastly, Mercury in Scorpio at 21 degrees will be throwing a square to Mars in Aquarius at 17 degrees, and a sextile to Pluto in Capricorn at 18 degrees. What you and others are saying and thinking around this full moon is charged, as a Scorpionic Mercury amplifies the voices of the inner troublemakers and ground-shakers. Again, the potential to be thrown off during this lunation is high. But Mercury can help you call upon those inner reserves of strength and communicate or ruminate on them.  Here, there is a fine line between being in power and being empowered. The urge to use speech and thought to control and protect what comes up will be there\u2014but at what vibration? As discussed before, Mars is the courageousness that helps us break new ground, or the anger and impulsiveness that can break down. Pluto\u2019s refined touch here can grant you a serious study, the wisdom to think before you speak, the command to convey and persuade, and the depth to contain what is said. This is a mind and these are words that can pierce past the facade, and acquaint us with truth and the authenticity of ourselves and others.And Taurus rules the vocal chords\u2014the literal conveyor of words. This is a beautiful synchronicity and a reminder to go softly no matter how rough the going can get around this moon. There is a substantial presence and power to the Taurus bull upon first look, maybe even a meanness. But past that, there is always a peace and placidity in their eyes. They are gentle creatures, and befitting for Venus. As daunting as this lunation may seem, the moon in Taurus here is and always will be a reminder of beauty and pleasure. So tend to yourself and others, and go sweetly","title-cc":63,"title-wc":14,"body-cc":5814,"body-wc":1045,"media":0,"comments":26},"2120":{"time":"2018-09-21","title":"I just made a little chart of planetary Transit Times\/Lengths.

It's awe-inspiring. It fills you with wonder. It makes you realise that there are much greater forces at work beyond your tiny little self. The realities of bill paying and mundane chores are a world away. You look out at the horizon and start to think big and dream and hope. You suddenly have a sense of perspective, understanding, faith, belief in something greater, something higher, something more- this is Jupiter. It is epic in scale, legendary, mythic, beyond words. It fills you up and carries you on a high, makes you soar on optimism and a fascination for what's out there, waiting to be uncovered and explored. It makes you seek out and discover, it gives you meaning and purpose in life, it's your compass. This is why it's the Greater Benefic. It rules priests and sages and gurus and philosophers and scholars. Those who dispense advice and spiritual wisdom.\u00a0Those who journey to find the truth and then teach and preach it to those willing to learn. And Jupiter does have the potential to shower you with knowledge, wonder, and blessings. Astronomically it's the Great Protector, its gravity pulling in comets that would otherwise smash into the Earth and slinging them away into deep space.HOWEVER Jupiter can also become self-righteous, self aggrandising and self-mythologising. Like the Sun it can have an inflated sense of self importance, which with Jupiter can veer into \"I'm divinely chosen, my beliefs are the right beliefs, and I'm meant to do something great, it's my calling.\" Jupiter can become a zealot. Jupiter can also be too abstract and theoretical and ungrounded, not at all rooted in reality. The professor who lectures from their ivory tower, who promises a lot with big dreams and grand visions but doesn't always deliver. Jupiter can leave you disappointed and disillusioned, the expectations you had about your life lying in pieces all around you. You'll see all these themes (the good and the bad) in the two signs it rules- Sagittarius and Pisces. You'll also see in them Jupiter's indulgence- its indulgence in experiences, alcohol, drugs, food, TV- whatever your vice is, Jupiter (when unhealthy) will want more of it. The expansiveness of Jupiter becomes untameable and unmanageable and can spiral into addiction.I wrote a bit of an essay there but I love writing about Jupiter. I feel I can speak to its nature with some authority because I have it conjunct my Ascendant and aspecting other vital planets in my chart. But I feel it's important for all of us to access our Jupiter and find that greater sense of purpose and vision in our lives. I'd love to know your thoughts on Jupiter.","title-cc":18,"title-wc":3,"body-cc":2883,"body-wc":499,"media":0,"comments":67},"2123":{"time":"2019-09-16","title":"Most common placements on this sub survey results","body-text":"First off I just want to apologize for taking this long, I\u2019ve been very busy with work and studying for college finals. Also I\u2019m sorry but I wasn\u2019t able to make bar graphs for all placements like I promised, I didn\u2019t really know how to. I went on Excel and made 3 bar graphs but they looked really ugly and confusing so I decided to only make bar graphs for the most common sun, moon and rising sign. If you want to see that as well as the pie graphs that google forums automatically generated you can find that here: https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/PH8YjIGFeel free to share how common (or rare) your placements are in the comments. Also let me know if there\u2019s anything that surprises or interests you.Also, I might post more surveys on here when I have the time (most likely during winter break after finals are over). I was thinking the next survey I could do would be about what houses are your placements in. I might also make a survey about what the most common aspects on this sub are. Let me know if you\u2019d be interested in this, also feel free to suggest other types of surveys I could make. Also, this survey includes 1% of the community.

Pluto might bring up more deeper levels of awareness of Aquarian topics in the collective than Jupiter would. Jupiter might focus on philosophy behind human networks and Pluto might focus on the deep primal need for connection between an individual human and humanity writ large.Generally, also the time the planet needs to transit a sign might change the impact as well. Pluto transiting Scorpio takes a much shorter time than transiting Taurus so perhaps the transit through Taurus might be much more deep, impactful and changing than it's transit through Scorpio was.Co-present planets and transits would also add an effect too. A Uranus and Pluto conjunction in Virgo would have a deeper and more long lasting\/permanent effect on the collective than a Jupiter and Pluto conjunction in Virgo just considering Jupiter only takes 1 year to transit a sign, compared to Uranus and Pluto which takes multiple years to, so also they would be co-present in a sign much longer than just Jupiter and Pluto would. I believe this would make a deeper dent in the energy felt over long periods of time and its impact in historical events within the energy of that astrology signWhat are your thoughts?","title-cc":46,"title-wc":7,"body-cc":1858,"body-wc":313,"media":0,"comments":0},"2142":{"time":"2022-08-31","title":"Are all those born between 2020-22 have 4th house planet placement because of COVID??","body-text":"I have recently read that people who are born during a world disaster often has fourth house in Saturn or Pluto\u2026.
